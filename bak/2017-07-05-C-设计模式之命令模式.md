行为变化模式

组建行为的变化经常

### 动机


### 定义

对象表征行为，对象可以作为参数，


A generic example would be you ordering a food at restaurant. You(i.e. Client) ask the waiter(i.e. Invoker) to bring some food(i.e. command) and waiter simply forwards the request to chef( i.e. Receiver) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook. Another example would be you( i.e. Client) switching on (i.e. Command) the television (i.e. Receiver) using a remote control (Invoker).


Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.


In OOP, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.


命令模式的本质是对命令进行封装，将发出命令的责任和执行命令的责任分割开。命令模式使请求本身成为一个对象，这个对象和其他对象一样可以被存储和传递。
