Voters may respect her while having trouble relating to her.

Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in the United States.

Hillary Clinton is viewed unfavorably by nearly 60 percent of Americans.

Somehow, both are true at the same time. How can that be?

The answer says a lot about women who break glass ceilings.

No woman has been in the public eye more in the last quarter-century than Clinton — and no woman has been so venerated. According to Gallup’s annual survey, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state has been rated the most admired woman in America 20 times over the past 23 years, including in its most recent December 2015 survey. Since the question was first asked by Gallup in 1948, Clinton has been top rated more than any other woman, besting even Mother Teresa; only Eleanor Roosevelt comes close, having been rated most-admired for 13 years in the 1940s and 1950s.

Democrats built on this admiration at the Democratic National Convention this week. “No matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits,” President Obama said. “That’s the Hillary I’ve come to admire.” First lady Michelle Obama hit the same theme: “What I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure.” Speaker after speaker reminded the hall that she’s been taking on battles since her early 20s, always in the service of others and always leading higher levels of achievement.

And yet, over the years, a significant majority of Americans has held unfavorable views of Clinton. Her overall favorability rating is historically low for the nominee of a major party (as is Donald Trump’s), but the negativity extends to perceptions of her character as well. In the 1990s and today, questions about her honesty and trustworthiness have been her biggest vulnerabilities.
