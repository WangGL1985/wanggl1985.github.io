**Creating functions**

Standard C and C++ use a feature called _function prototyping_. With function prototyping, you must use a description of the types of arguments when declaring and defining a function. This description is the "prototype". The order and type of the arguments must match in the declaration, definiton, and function call.

> int translate( float x, float y, float z);

The form of function declaration is also acceptable:

> int translate(float, float, float);

Since the compiler doesn't do anything but check for types when the function is called.
