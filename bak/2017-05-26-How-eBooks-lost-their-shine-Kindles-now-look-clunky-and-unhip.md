Just a few years ago, the Kindle was being blamed for the death of the traditional book. But the latest figures show a dramatic **reversal** of **fortunes**, with sales of ebooks **plunging**『跌落』. So what’s behind this **resurgence**?

- reversal : A reversal of a process, policy, or trend is a complete change in it.
- fortunes: If you talk about someone's fortunes or the fortunes of something, you are talking about the extent to which they are doing well or being successful.
- plunging: drop or fall from heigh
- resurgence : If there is a resurgence of an attitude or activity, it reappears and grows.


Here are some things that you can’t do with a Kindle. You can’t turn down a corner, tuck a flap in a chapter, crack a **spine** (brutal, but sometimes pleasurable) or flick the pages to see how far you have come and how far you have to go. You can’t remember something potent and find it again with reference to where it appeared on a right- or left-hand page. You often can’t remember much at all. You can’t tell whether the end is really the end, or whether the end equals 93% followed by 7% of index and/or questions for book clubs. You can’t pass it on to a friend or post it through your neighbour’s door.

- spine : The spine of a book is the narrow stiff part which the pages and covers are attached to.


A few years ago, I was given a Kindle. I had become a student again. I was reading lots of books and I needed them cheap and light. But now the Kindle has slipped to the back of the desk drawer behind the Blu-Tack that comes out only at Christmas. Meanwhile, the stack of hardbacks and paperbacks on the bedside table has grown so tall it has spawned sub-stacks on the floor; when I get into bed at night, it is like looking down on a miniature book city. I don’t want to speculate about what goes on in other people’s bedrooms but I suspect it might be something similar, because figures published today by the Publishing Association show that sales of consumer ebooks have dropped by 17%, while sales of physical books are up 8%. Consumer spending on books was up £89m across the board last year, compared with 2015. So why is the physical book winning through?
