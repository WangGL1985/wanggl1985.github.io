Hamilton is a musical about the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, with music, lyrics and book by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The show, inspired by the 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton by historian Ron Chernow, achieved both critical acclaim and box office success.

The musical made its Off-Broadway debut at The Public Theater in February 2015, where its engagement was sold out. The show transferred to Broadway in August 2015 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. On Broadway, it received enthusiastic critical acclaim and unprecedented advance box office sales. Nominated for a record-setting 16 Tony Awards, the production ultimately won 11, including Best Musical, and is also the recipient of the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album and the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

At the airport, while on a vacation from his hit Broadway show In The Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda decided to pick up and read Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, a biography of Alexander Hamilton. After finishing the first couple of chapters, Miranda quickly began envisioning the life of Hamilton as a musical and researched whether or not a stage musical of his life had been created. A play of Hamilton's story had been done on Broadway in 1917, starring George Arliss as Alexander Hamilton.

Upon Miranda's discovery he began a project entitled The Hamilton Mixtape and worked on it during his spare time from In The Heights. On May 12, 2009, Miranda was invited to perform music from In The Heights at the White House Evening of Poetry, Music and the Spoken Word. Instead he performed the first song from The Hamilton Mixtape, a rough version which would later become "Alexander Hamilton", Hamilton's opening number. He spent a year after that working on "My Shot", another early number from the show.
