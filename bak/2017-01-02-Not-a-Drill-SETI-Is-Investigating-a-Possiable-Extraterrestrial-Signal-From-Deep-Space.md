If the signal is truly from an alien world, it’s one far more advanced than ours

An international team of scientists from the **Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)** is investigating mysterious **signal spikes** emitting from a 6.3-billion-year-old star in the **constellation** Hercules—95 light years away from Earth. The **implications** are extraordinary and point to the possibility of a civilization far more advanced than our own.

The unusual signal was originally detected on May 15, 2015, by the Russian Academy of Science-operated RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia, but was kept secret from the international community. **Interstellar** space reporter [Paul Gilster broke the story](http://go.skimresources.com/?id=85704X1538064&site=observer.com&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.centauri-dreams.org%2F%3Fp%3D36248&xguid=&xuuid=7fc7192344e26f7f12ca00a150076f60&xsessid=&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=http%3A%2F%2Fobserver.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fnot-a-drill-seti-is-investigating-a-possible-extraterrestrial-signal-from-deep-space%2F&xtz=-480&abp=1) after the researchers quietly **circulated** a paper announcing the detection of “a strong signal in the direction of HD164595.”

The mysterious star’s designation is HD164595, and it’s considered to be sun-like in nature with a nearly identical metallic composition to our own star. So far, a single Neptune-like (but warmer) planet has been discovered in its orbit—HD 164595 b. But as Gilster explained, “There could, of course, be other planets still undetected in this system.”

**Decorated** Italian SETI researcher and mathematician Claudio Maccone along with Russia’s Nikolai Bursov of the Special Astrophysical **Observatory** are the principal scientists working on the apparent discovery. They claim that “permanent monitoring of this target is needed.”

“The signal **conceivably** fits the profile for an intentional transmission from an extraterrestrial source,” said Alan Boyle, author of The Case for **Pluto** who reported the story for Geekwire. “In any case, the **blip**<sub/>尖峰</sub> is interesting enough to merit discussion by those who specialize in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.”

The signal’s strength indicates that if it in fact came from a **isotropic beacon**, the power source would have to be built by a Kardashev Type II civilization. (The [Kardashev scale](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%A1%E5%B0%94%E8%BE%BE%E8%82%96%E5%A4%AB%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B0) is used to determine the progress of a civilization’s technological development by measuring how much energy was used to transmit an interstellar message.) An ‘Isotropic’ beacon means a communication source emitting a signal with equal power in all directions while promoting signal strength throughout travel.

In his acclaimed work “Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations,” Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev explained that a Type II civilization would be able to harness the energy of their entire host star. The most common hypothetical example of this would be a Dyson Sphere—which is a massive artificial structure that could completely encapsulate a star and transfer the energy to a nearby planet.

Basically, if the signal was **beamed out** into the galaxy without aim or direction, that would require an enormous amount of power to actually be detected. But what if the signal was beamed specifically at our solar system? Well, that would require less energy and could **indicate** the presence of a Kardashev Type I civilization—meaning that it could be a highly technological, contemporary society that harnesses the solar energy emitted by its local star, much like our planet does with solar panels. This particular civilization’s social structure **is theorized to** be completely globalized and interconnected.

“The signal is **provocative** enough that the RATAN-600 researchers are calling for permanent monitoring of this target,” said Gilster. And that’s exactly what is transpiring. As of last night, the SETI institute is diverting its Allen Telescope Array in northern California to investigate while their **counterparts** at METI International (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) will use Panama’s Boquete Optical Observatory.

The detection of the mysterious signal and the **ensuing** investigations will be discussed at the IAA SETI Permanent Committee during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 27—the same day and location where Elon Musk will reveal his plans to colonize Mars. The Observer will be following up on both these stories from the **Congress**.
