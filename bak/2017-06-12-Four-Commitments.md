Making **commitments** sounds intimidating, but it’s not. Making a commitment simply means falling in love with something, and then building a structure of behavior around it that will carry you through when your love falters.

- A commitment is something which regularly takes up some of your time because of an agreement you have made or because of responsibilities that you have.

When you make a commitment to something you truly love, whether it’s a **spouse**, a job, a company, or a school, it won’t feel like you are putting on an uncomfortable **lobster** shell. It will feel like you are taking off the shell and becoming the shape you were meant to be.

- Someone's spouse is the person they are married to.
- A lobster is a sea creature that has a hard shell, two large claws, and eight legs.

When you’re making a commitment, you won’t be paralyzed by self-focus because you’ll have something besides yourself to think about.

Specifically, as you go through your 30s, you will make four major commitments, and your life depends on how you do with these four things.

First, a commitment to your spouse and to your family. Second, a commitment to a career and a vocation. Third, a commitment to your **faith** or **philosophy**. Fourth, a commitment to a community and a village.

- If you have faith in someone or something, you feel confident about their ability or goodness.
- A philosophy is a particular theory that someone has about how to live or how to deal with a particular situation
