We are sending kids the wrong message about adulthood. Here’s what needs to change.

>By Judy Mollen Walters


My 22-year-old daughter had an adult moment recently. A graduate student with an internship, she recently was seeing a client, who, at the end of their meeting, called her Ms. Walters and asked for her business card. “I think I’m an adult,” she texted me.

There are so many ways — little and big — that we mark our kids’ passage to adulthood. When I was in the process of becoming an adult, it seemed like getting married was one marker, though at the time I wasn’t thinking, “Now I’m an adult.” I was thinking that I was so happy to be married to my husband.

Then I had my first baby — the now 22-year-old — and I was really an adult. Within just a few years I had a mortgage and two babies. It’s what people did. I never thought about it much, at least not consciously. I was just living my life. Becoming an adult — didn’t that just … happen? Or was it more complicated than that?

These days it feels like we shift our young people ever so gradually and tenderly toward adulthood that they can barely feel themselves doing it. There are books everywhere teaching children how to become adults, or telling us to teach them how to do it. It never dawned on me that I would need to learn to teach my child to become an adult. Doesn’t it just happen naturally at some point? Didn’t we celebrate our child’s every birthday not only with cake and candles, but also with the idea that becoming a year older was something to mark?

I feel like not so much. Many of us send our children the message that being an adult is bad. That being an adult is too hard. That you’re better off not being an adult. And what we get in return is a lot of kids who, well, don’t turn into adults.
