Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multipe options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionally is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionally. Let me better explain it using the code example below.



Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionally of another class.


A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serbing object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionally can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.
