2.  The remains floated ashore in June of 2014, in the Pribilof Islands community of St. George, a tiny oasis of rock and grass in the middle of Alaska's Bering Sea. A young biology teacher spotted the carcass half-buried in sand on a desolate windswept beach. He alerted a former fur seal researcher who presumed, at first, that she knew what they'd found: a Baird's beaked whale, **a large, gray, deep-diving creature that occasionally washes in dead with the tide.**



- wash 及物

>- The storm washed our boat ashore.

- wash 不及物，有拟人的作用。无灵主语（无生命的名词作为主语）


>- We found a shell that had washed up.
>- The boat had washed ashore during the storm.
>- The hillside washes frequently.



- in dead  最寂静、黑暗、寒冷的时刻 (作为名词，形容词时不用 `in`)

> in the dead of winter/night

> Waiting on the top of the mountain in the dead of a winter night made the sunrise more spectacular for the brightness and warmth the sun brought.

3.  But a closer examination later showed that the flesh was too dark, the dorsal fin too big and floppy. The animal was too short to be an adult, but its teeth were worn and yellowed with age.

4.  It **turns out**, according to new research published Tuesday, **that this was** not a Baird's beaked whale at all, but **an entirely new species**—a smaller, odd-shaped black cetacean that Japanese fishermen have long called karasu, or raven.

- raven 大乌鸦

> It turns out that this was an entirely new species.

5.  "We don't know how many there are, ~~(and)~~ where they're typically found, anything," says Phillip Morin, a molecular geneticist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. "But we're going to start looking."

6.  It’s rare to uncover a new species of whale. Advances(无灵主语，强调客观) in DNA research have helped scientists ~~to（make/let/have ... do ...）~~ identify five new cetaceans in the past 15 years but two were dolphins and most were simple category splits between fairly similar species. _This animal, in the genus Berardius, **looks** far different than its nearest relative and **inhabits** an area of the North Pacific where (定语从句) marine mammal research has been conducted （被动） for decades._

- genus 【生】界

>- Peking ducks are different from/than Nanjing ducks.
>- The mountain looks different in morning than in the evening.
>- This is the Chinese view of the state, very different to that of ours.

- be different ... from/than/to
  - from/than 比较
  - to   强调不同


>- American cars are different from/than ours.
>- He looks different in person than in the movies.
>- Some languages answer questions in a different way to English.



- inhabit（住在）vt 直接跟地点

>- He inhabited a small 2-room apartment.
>- Fish inhabit the sea.

7.  IT'S JUST SO EXCITING TO THINK THAT IN 2016 WE'RE STILL DISCOVERING THINGS IN OUR WORLD—EVEN MAMMALS THAT ARE MORE THAN 20 FEET LONG. "It's a really big deal," says study co-author Paul Wade of NOAA's National Marine Mammal Laboratory. "If you think about it, on land, discovery of new species of large mammals is exceptionally rare. It just doesn't happen very often. It's quite remarkable."

### SKELETONS, BEAKS, AND BONE POWDER

8.  Morin and his team examined the St. George carcass, took bone powder from old museum specimens, and reviewed DNA tests of whales from the Sea of Okhotsk. They studied skulls and beaks and analyzed records from whaling fleets in Japan. They even tracked down a skeleton hanging from the ceiling in a high school gymnasium in the Aleutian Islands.

9.  <span style="background-color:lightgray"> The scientists conclude in their study published in Marine Mammal Science **that** this type of whale, which has not yet been named, is nearly **as** _far_ removed genetically _from_ the Northern Hemisphere's Baird's beaked whales **as** it is _~~(far)~~_ _from_ its closest known relative, Arnoux's beaked whales, which swim in the Antarctic Ocean.</span> The differences, in fact, are so dramatic that the animal has to be something else, they say.

> Beijing is nearly as far located geographically from Zhagjiakou as it is ~~far~~ from Baoding, which is famous for preserved vegetables.


10. "It's just so exciting to think that in 2016 we're still discovering things in our world—even mammals that are more than 20 feet long," Morin says.

>This skull of a newly discovered species of whale shows its blowhole vestibule and its nasal and frontal bones.


11. He is not alone in his enthusiasm. Robert Pitman serves on a taxonomy committee for the Society for Marine Mammalogy, which publishes an annual list of all recognized marine mammal species. He is not among the 16 co-authors on Morin's paper. But at a time when the diversity of marine mammals is shrinking—the Yangtze River dolphin is now functionally extinct and Mexico’s vaquita porpoise is dangerously close—Pitman calls the discovery "heartening."

- functionally extinct 功能性灭绝

> 野外种群即使存在，但由于数量的稀少、基因多样性的缺乏和生态环境的恶劣，仅仅靠自身也不足以自然恢复健康的种群。


12. "It boggles my mind to think that a large, very different-looking whale has gone unnoticed by the scientific community for so long," Pitman says. "It sends a clear message about how little we know about what is in the ocean around us."

13. The discovery also raises new questions about how well humans are understanding the threats **posed** by marine activities, from energy exploration to sonar use, **given that** so few people even knew such a creature existed.

- pose 造成
- given(介词) that   考虑到

> Given that success and the current knee injury, what's your goal for the U.S. Open and beyond?



### AN UNRECOGNIZABLE, BAFFLING CREATURE

14. Of the 88 recognized living cetacean species, including orcas and humpbacks, bottlenose dolphins and Dall's porpoises, 22 are beaked whales. The largest of those, Baird's beaked whales, also called giant bottlenose whales, can reach 35 to 40 feet (10.7 to 12 meters) and weigh more than 24,000 pounds (10,900 kilograms). They travel in large groups, may dive 3,000 feet (914 meters), and can be underwater for an hour. While beaked whales are still hunted in Japan, little about them is known. In part that’s because they spend so much time feeding and exploring vast, deep canyons far from shore.

15. **When** Christian Hagenlocher on St. George, a 35-square-mile (91-square-kilometer) island **inhabited** by 100 people, **frequented** by hundreds of thousands of seals, and **visited** by 2.5 million birds, **pointed out** the dead whale in Zapadni Bay to former seal researcher Karin Holser, **she thought it was a Baird's beaked whale.** But later, as tides and currents revealed more of the animal, Holser realized she didn't recognize it at all. She consulted a colleague's cetacean identification book and sent pictures to other experts in Alaska.

> This skull provided scientists evidence that the whale was smaller and had different bone structure than other beaked whales.

16. "This dorsal fin was larger, further aft, and had more curvature than that of a Baird's beaked whale," says independent ecologist Michelle Ridgway, who arrived on the island days later. "The jaw structure and the shape of the melon were not quite right, either.” And this whale, while clearly an adult, was just two-thirds the size of full-grown Baird’s beaked whales.

17. Holser and other island residents measured the whale. Ridgway collected tissue, arranging to ship the slightly fetid samples through intermediaries to Morin's lab in Southern California.

Morin was intrigued.

### SO MYSTERIOUS IT'S 'ALMOST FOLKLORE'

18. Just nine months earlier, he'd **_spied_** new research by Japanese scientists attempting to describe differences between Baird's beaked whales and a rare black form that whalers **had whispered** about since the 1940s. Groups of these smaller whales were sometime spotted in Japan’s Nemuro Strait, but only between April and June. There was no record of scientists ever seeing one alive.

- whisper about sth
- the cove 海豚湾


19. "They're almost folklore," Morin says.

20. The Japanese scientists had speculated in fall of 2013 that this may be an unknown species of beaked whale. But they were forced to draw conclusions from DNA taken from just three of the creatures that had stranded off Hokkaido. They concluded more evidence was needed.

21. Even before receiving the samples from St. George, Morin had been trying to hunt down more specimens.

22. He went through NOAA's tissue collection, pulling all 50 or so that had previously been identified as a Baird's beaked whale. Using DNA testing **~~,~~** he found that two were actually a closer genetic match to the small black whales tested by Japanese scientists in 2013. One of those was from a whale that washed ashore in 2004 and now hangs in a school gym in Dutch Harbor. Scientists there had long assumed it was a younger Baird's beaked whale.

>- Looking from the top of the mountain, I think ...
>- Looked from the top of the mountain, the ...

23. Morin also took the suggestion of one of the Japanese scientists, who had identified a skeleton from 1948 with an unusual shaped head at the Smithsonian Institution. And he tracked down another skeleton from the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History with body measurements that suggested they were the small black form. Morin took bone powder from both, and tested their DNA. They, too, were a match for karasu.

24. Along with the whale from St. George, Morin now had found five new specimens that were similar to the three found in Japan.

25. To describe a new species, however, "you build up lines of evidence, but that's very hard with an animal we've never seen alive," Morin says. But body measurements between Baird's beaked whales and the smaller black creature proved vastly different, as did their DNA.

26. Baird's beaked whales range throughout the North Pacific from Russia and Japan to Mexico. Genetic variation among Baird’s beaked whales was tiny. But for the five new black specimens Morin tested, all initially from the Bering Sea or the Aleutians, the sequences differed from the Baird's beaked whales significantly.

27. "The genetic variation within the forms was little, while the divergence between them was much larger," Morin says. "That's our strongest argument."

28. The whale still needs to be formally described and named, and Morin's findings would have to be accepted by outside experts who track cetacean taxonomy. But Pitman and others say the case is strong that it’s a new species.

29. "We're doing increasing damage to our environment, and we can't even begin to conserve the **_biodiversity_** we know **~~(that)~~** is out there," Morin says. "Yet there's so much more about our world we don't even understand."
