MY NAME IS APOLLO. I used to be a god. In my four thousand six hundred and twelve years, I have done many things. I inflicted a plague on the Greeks who **besieged** Troy. I blessed Babe Ruth with three home runs in game four of the 1926 World Series. I visited my **wrath** upon Britney Spears at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards.

>- besiege   围攻
>-  be blessed with

But in all my **immortal** life, I never before crash-landed in a Dumpster.
>- Dumpster  n :  a container designed to receive and transport and dump waste


I’m not even sure how it happened.

I simply woke up falling. **Skyscrapers** **spiraled** in and out of view. Flames streamed off my body. I tried to fly. I tried to change into a cloud or teleport across the world or do a hundred other things that should have been easy for me, but I just kept falling. I plunged into a narrow canyon between two buildings and BAM!

Is anything sadder than the sound of a god hitting a pile of garbage bags?

I lay **groaning** and aching in the open Dumpster. My nostrils burned with the stench of rancid bologna and used diapers. My ribs felt broken, though that shouldn’t have been possible.

My mind stewed in confusion, but one memory floated to the surface—the voice of my father, Zeus: YOUR FAULT. YOUR PUNISHMENT.

I realized what had happened to me. And I sobbed in despair.

Even for a god of poetry such as myself, it is difficult to describe how I felt. How could you—a mere mortal—possibly understand? Imagine being **stripped** of your clothes, then **blasted** with a fire hose in front of a laughing crowd. Imagine the ice-cold water filling your mouth and lungs, the pressure **bruising** your skin, turning your joints to putty. Imagine feeling helpless, ashamed, completely vulnerable—publicly and brutally stripped of everything that makes you you. My **humiliation** was worse than that.
