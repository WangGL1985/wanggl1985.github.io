Did you ever have fresh tea from some stall? They often make more than one cup that you demanded and save the rest for any other customer so to save the resources e.g. gas etc. Flyweight pattern is all about i.e. sharing.

It is used to minimize usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.


In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern, A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.



享元模式的核心在于享元工厂类，享元工厂类的作用在于提供一个用于存储享元对象的享元池，用户需要对象时，首先从享元池中获取，如果享元池中不存在，则创建一个新的享元对象返回给用户，并在享元池中保存该新增对象。
