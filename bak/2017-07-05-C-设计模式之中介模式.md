A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator.


Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation.


In software engineering, the medicator pattern defines a object that encapulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be behavioral pattern due to way it can alter the program's running behavior.
