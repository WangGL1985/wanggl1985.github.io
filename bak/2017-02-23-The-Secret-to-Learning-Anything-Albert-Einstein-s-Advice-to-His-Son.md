[1] In 1915, aged thirty-six, Einstein was living in wartorn Berlin, while his wife and their two sons, Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard “Tete” Einstein, lived in comparatively safe Vienna. On November 4 of that year, having just completed the two-page **masterpiece** , his theory of general relativity, Einstein sent 11-year-old Hans Albert the following letter.

>My dear Albert,<br>
>Yesterday I received your dear letter and was very happy with it. I was already afraid you wouldn’t write to me at all any more. You told me when I was in Zurich, that it is awkward for you when I come to Zurich. Therefore I think it is better if we get together in a different place, where nobody will interfere with our comfort. I will in any case urge that each year we spend a whole month together, so that you see that you have a father who is fond of you and who loves you. You can also learn many good and beautiful things from me, something another cannot as easily offer you. What I have achieved through such a lot of strenuous work shall not only be there for strangers but especially for my own boys. These days I have completed one of the most beautiful works of my life, when you are bigger, I will tell you about it.

>I am very pleased that you find joy with the piano. This and carpentry are in my opinion for your age the best pursuits, better even than school. Because those are things which fit a young person such as you very well. Mainly play the things on the piano which please you, even if the teacher does not assign those. That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes. I am sometimes so <b>wrapped up in</b> my work that I forget about the noon meal. . . .<br>

## Sherwood Anderson on Art and Life: A Letter of Advice to His Teenage Son


[1] The quest to find one’s purpose and live the creative life boldly is neither simple nor easy, especially for a young person trying to make sense of the world and his place in it.In the spring of 1926, Sherwood Anderson sent his seventeen-year-old son John a letter.

>The best thing, I dare say, is first to learn something well so you can always make a living. Bob seems to be catching on at the newspaper business and has had another raise. He is getting a good training by working in a smaller city. As for the scientific fields, any of them require a long schooling and intense application. If you are made for it nothing could be better. In the long run you will have to come to your own conclusion.<br>
The arts, which probably offer a man more satisfaction, are uncertain. It is difficult to make a living.<br>
If I had my own life to lead over I presume I would still be a writer but I am sure I would give my first attention to learning how to do things directly with my hands. Nothing gives quite the satisfaction that doing things brings.<br>
Above all，avoid taking the advice of men who have no brains and do not know what they are talking about.Most small businessmen say simply — ‘Look at me.’ They fancy that if they have accumulated a little money and have got a position in a small circle they are competent to give advice to anyone.<br>
Next to occupation is the building up of good taste. That is difficult, slow work. Few achieve it. It means all the difference in the world in the end.<br>
I am constantly amazed at how little painters know about painting, writers about writing, merchants about business, manufacturers about manufacturing.<b>Most men just drift.</b><br>
There is a kind of shrewdness many men have that enables them to get money. It is the shrewdness of the fox after the chicken. A low order of mentality often goes with it.<br>
Above all I would like you to see many kinds of men at first hand. That would help you more than anything. Just how it is to be accomplished I do not know. Perhaps a way may be found. Anyway, I’ll see you this summer. We begin to pack for the country this week.<br>
With love,<br>
Dad.<br>

[3] The following year, after Anderson and his wife took eighteen-year-old John and his sister to Europe, the boy remained in Paris to study painting. Drawing on his own artistic experience and the **parallels** between writing and painting, Sherwood sent John another **poignant** letter of advice in April of 1927.


>In relation to painting.
Don’t be carried off your feet by anything because it is modern — the latest thing.<br>
Go to the Louvre often and spend a good deal of time before the Rembrandts, the Delacroixs.<br>
Learn to draw. Try to make your hand so unconsciously **adept** that it will put down what you feel without your having to think of your hands.<br>
Then you can think of the thing before you.<br>
Draw things that have some meaning to you. An apple, what does it mean? The object drawn doesn’t matter so much.<br>
It’s what you feel about it, what it means to you.<br>
A masterpiece could be made of a dish of turnips.<br>
Draw, draw, hundreds of drawings.<br>
<u>**Try to remain humble. Smartness kills everything.**</u><br>
The object of art is not to make salable pictures. It is to save yourself.<br>
Any cleanness I have in my own life is due to my feeling for words.<br>
The fools who write articles about me think that one morning I suddenly decided to write and began to produce masterpieces.<br>
There is no special trick about writing or painting either. I wrote constantly for 15 years before I produced anything with any solidity to it.<br>
The thing of course, is to make yourself alive. Most people remain all of their lives in a stupor.<br>
The point of being an artist is that you may live.<br>
You won’t arrive. It is an endless search.<br>
I write as though you were a man. Well, you must know my heart is set on you. It isn’t your success I want.<br>
There is a possibility of your having a decent attitude toward people and work. That alone may make a man of you.<br>
