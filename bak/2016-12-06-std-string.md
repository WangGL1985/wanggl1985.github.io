>A **variable** is an **object** that has a name. An object, in turn, is a part of the computer's memory that has a type.  The distinction between objects and variables is important because, it is possiable to have objects that do not have names.

There are three events that cause the system to flush the output buffer:

-   The buffer might be full
-   The library might be asked ti read from the standard input stream
-   when we explicitly say to do so

Initialization froms:

-   direct initialization
-   copy initialization

    when we want to use several values to initializ a string, we can indirectly use the copy form of initization by explicitly creating a (trmporary) object to copy.

when we mix strings and string or character literals, at least one openand to each `+` operator must be of string type.

>For historical reasons, and for compatibility with C, string literals are not standard library strings. It is important to remember that these types differ when you use string literals and library strings.
