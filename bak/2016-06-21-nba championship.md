Cavaliers end over 50 years of Cleveland sports heartbreak with first NBA championship。

> By Tim Bontemps[^1]

These are the moments that create legends. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night, **the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers** were tied inside the final minute of one of the great games in the history of the league, on the grandest of stages.

And with one flick of his wrist, Kyrie Irving not only launched himself into the annals of history, but he also smashed a 52-year curse.

Irving’s three-pointer with 53 seconds left lifted the **Cavaliers** to a 93-89 victory in front of a **stunned sellout crowd** inside Oracle Arena, ending the city of Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought and making the Cavaliers the first team to recover from a three-games-to-one deficit in NBA Finals history.

“History was made tonight,” Irving said. “This was one for the books. Literally one for the books.”

...

The sense of history was palpable inside the arena Sunday night, with the stakes impossibly high for both teams. For Golden State, it was one more chance to finish off what would be the greatest season in NBA history, capping a record-setting 73-win regular season with a second straight championship. For Cleveland, it was a chance to end a half-century’s worth of heartbreak and for James to deliver what would be the signature moment of his spectacular career.

And for the first time in a series that has seen everything else, the Warriors and Cavaliers proceeded to play a tight, **compelling** game more than worthy of such an occasion. **Emphatic** blocks, fearless drives, three-point **bombs**, 20 lead changes and 11 ties — this game offered everything.

...

“We had a phenomenal season,” **Warriors Coach Steve Kerr** said. “Obviously we did something that’s never been done before. Couldn’t finish it off.”

Since the end of the regular season, the expectation had been that the past two months would be little more than a coronation.

Reality, though, turned out to be far different. Knee and ankle injuries derailed Curry’s playoffs, and he never consistently recovered the form he showed during his unanimous MVP regular season.

...

Cleveland took advantage of it and, with one flick of Irving’s wrist, erased a half-century’s worth of pain and frustration.
