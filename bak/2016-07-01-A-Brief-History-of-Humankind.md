About 14.5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics.

About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy began to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry.
 
About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology.
 
About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.
 
Three important revolutions shaped the courseof history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end historyand start something completely different. This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms.
