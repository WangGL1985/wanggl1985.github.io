# CHAPTER 1

## Do You Know Where You Are Going?

<!-- more -->
**THE FIRST STEP TO GETTING ANYWHERE IS TO DECIDE WHERE YOU want to go.** That seems so obvious that you may be wondering why I bothered to say it. Well, for one thing, despite its obviousness, you’d be surprised to learn just how often we completely forget to do it. Oh sure, you feel like you’ve set a lot of goals for yourself, but have you really? Or have you just thought about how you’d like to be happier, healthier, or more successful, without actually deciding what specifically you were going to do about it? You have desires, lots and lots of things that you want to happen, but how many of those wishes have you turned into real goals? **Without being translated into goals, our desires remain just that—things we wish would happen.** Imagine you want to take a nice vacation. If your planning never gets any further than “I’d like to go someplace warm,” you’re probably not going anywhere, are you?

So setting goals is important, and in this chapter I’ll describe some research that shows us why. But that’s not the whole story. Because how you set your goals—the way you think about whatever it is you want to do, and how you will get there—is every bit as important. **Success is more likely when you focus on the right details, in the right way.**

## Don’t Do Your Best

Telling someone to “do your best” is a great way to motivate them, right? Most of us have said or heard this expression _countless times_. It’s always meant well—do your best is supposed to inspire you without putting on too much pressure. It’s supposed to bring out the best in you. **Only** it doesn’t. It’s a really _lousy motivator_.

And that’s primarily because do your best is very, very vague. What is my best, exactly? Imagine you are a manager, and you’ve given your employee an assignment to investigate a possibly lucrative sales opportunity for your company. It’s something that requires a lot of work. And it’s really important. So you tell your employee, “Bob, do your best on this one.” But what is Bob’s best? How would you know it if you saw it? And for that matter, how would Bob? Does Bob even really know what his best looks like? Does anyone?

The reality is that no one hears do your best and thinks, “I will work on this until I can’t possibly make it even the tiniest bit better.” That would be silly and probably far too time-consuming to be of benefit to you or to Bob. Instead, we hear do your best and think, “I will do a good enough job so that my boss will believe this is my best and be happy with it.” Not exactly inspiring stuff. **In _the absence of_ a specific goal, do your best somewhat ironically tends to produce work that is far from the best—it’s _a recipe for mediocrity_.** So what’s the alternative? **The alternative is to set specific, difficult goals.** Edwin Locke and Gary Latham, two eminent organizational psychologists, have spent several decades studying the extraordinary effectiveness of setting specific and difficult goals. In more than one thousand studies conducted by researchers across the globe, they’ve found that goals that spell out exactly what needs to be accomplished, and that set the bar for achievement high, result in far superior performance than goals that are vague or that set the bar too low. And this is true regardless of whether the goal is something you adopt on your own, something you are assigned to complete, or something that you develop jointly with your parent, teacher, boss, or coworkers.

Why are specific, difficult goals more motivating than do your best? The specific part is relatively straightforward. Letting people know exactly what is expected of them (or deciding for yourself exactly what you want to achieve) removes the possibility of settling for less—of telling yourself that what you’ve done is “good enough.” When what you’re striving for is vague, it’s too tempting to take the easy way out when you’ve gotten tired, discouraged, or bored. But there’s just no fooling yourself if you’ve set a specific goal. **You’ve either reached it or you haven’t. And if you haven’t, you’ve got little choice but to keep on trying if you want to succeed.**

What about the difficult part? Isn’t it dangerous to set difficult goals—aren’t I asking for trouble if I set the bar high? Aren’t I inviting disappointment and failure? Absolutely not! (And haven’t you ever seen Stand and Deliver? If Mr. Escalante could teach calculus to remedial math students, imagine what you could achieve if you dared to try!) Of course, you shouldn’t set goals that are not realistic or are impossible to reach. **Difficult but possible is the key.** That’s because more difficult goals cause you to, often unconsciously, increase your effort, focus, and commitment to the goal; persist longer; and make better use of the most effective strategies.

Locke and Latham have shown this to be true in groups of people as diverse in their day-to-day goals as scientists, businessmen, truck drivers, unionized workers, and loggers. In one study conducted in the early 1970s, Latham found that log haulers were carrying loads to the mill that were 60 percent of the legal weight limit, on average—a situation that was wasting both time and company resources. But the log haulers did not have any specific goals about what they should be carrying for each load. So he assigned them the goal of carrying loads that were 94 percent of the legal limit instead. He returned after nine months and found that they were now averaging above 90 percent, saving the company what would be many millions in today’s dollars.

So if you give log haulers the goal of carrying a lot more trees, it turns out they carry a lot more trees. People pretty much do what is asked of them, and rarely more. Ask for a great performance from someone, and as long as you’re specific about what great is, you are much more likely to actually get it. Set yourself difficult goals, and your performance will rise to the challenge. In one study of nearly three thousand federal employees, those who agreed with statements like “my job is challenging” and “people in my work group are expected to work hard” were the ones that had the highest ratings on their annual performance reviews.

But they were miserable, right? Wrong. Setting and achieving challenging goals has other added benefits besides great performance. Think about a time in your life when you accomplished something really difficult, and compare that to how you felt when you pulled off something relatively easy. Which feels better? **Succeeding at something hard is more pleasurable, gives greater satisfaction and happiness, and increases your overall sense of well-being. Succeeding at something easy is barely worth mentioning.** A recent study in Germany showed that only those employees who felt their work was difficult reported increases in job satisfaction, happiness, and feelings of achievement over time.

You might be wondering if being satisfied at work leads to better performance, or if it’s that better work performance creates satisfaction. The answer is that actually both are true—job satisfaction increases people’s commitment to their organization and confidence in themselves, which leads them to challenge themselves more, which leads to better performance and more satisfaction, and so on and so on ... **setting specific, challenging goals creates a cycle of success and happiness that can repeat itself over and over again, creating what Locke and Latham call the “_high performance cycle_.”**

You too can start this cycle in your own life—the first step is to set yourself some very specific and reasonably difficult goals. And you can further enhance your chances for success by thinking about those goals in the most motivating ways.

## The Big Picture versus the Nitty-Gritty

Any action you take or goal you adopt can be described or thought about in a number of different ways. Using a vacuum can be called “keeping things clean” or “sucking up crumbs from the floor.” Wanting to get an A on a math test can be thought of as wanting to “get almost all of the answers correct” or “master algebra.” Working out regularly can be about “trying to lose 10 pounds” or “trying to become more fit.”

### How Do You Think about the Things You Do?

Before you read on, answer the questions below to see how you typically think about the things you do. Jot down your answers in a notebook or on a piece of paper. There are no right, wrong, or even better answers. Choose the description that best describes the behavior for you—the one that sounds right to your ears.
1. Making a list is
    a. getting organized
    b. writing things down
2. Cleaning the house is
    a. showing one’s cleanliness
    b. vacuuming the floor
3. Paying the rent is
    a. maintaining a place to live
    b. writing a check
4. Locking a door is
    a. putting a key in the lock
    b. securing the house
5. Greeting someone is
    a. saying hello
    b. showing friendliness

To score, add up your choices to create a total score using the following numerical values: 1a = 2, 1b = 1, 2a = 2, 2b = 1, 3a = 2, 3b = 1, 4a = 1, 4b = 2, 5a = 1, 5b = 2 3

If you scored 6 or higher, you are probably someone who tends to think about their own behavior in more abstract terms—when you think about the things you do each day, you describe them by focusing on why you are doing them. So pushing a vacuum around the house is about “keeping things clean”— wanting the house to be clean is the reason you are vacuuming, so that’s how you think of it. If you scored a 5 or lower, you are probably someone who tends to think in more concrete terms. You think about your behavior in terms of what you are doing. So pushing the vacuum is about “sucking up crumbs”—it’s what is actually happening, so that’s how you think of it.

Both descriptions of vacuuming are accurate, so it’s not as if one kind of description is right and the other is wrong. But they are different, and importantly so. Because it turns out that the abstract why and concrete what ways of thinking about your behavior have motivational pros and cons. Each mode of thinking, under different circumstances, can lead to greater achievement. The trick is to adjust your thinking according to your circumstances, and the good news is that it’s not at all hard to do. You just need to learn when to think why and when to think what.
