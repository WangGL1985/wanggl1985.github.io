1.  ONE of the biggest complaints in modern society is being overscheduled, overcommitted and overextended. Ask people at a social gathering how they are and **the stock answer** is “super busy,” “crazy busy” or “insanely busy”. Nobody is just “fine” anymore.

2.  When people aren’t super busy at work, they are crazy busy exercising, entertaining or taking their kids to Chinese lessons. Or maybe they are insanely busy playing fantasy football, tracing their **genealogy** or **churning** their own butter.

>- be busy doing sth
>- genealogy: 家谱
>- churn: 搅拌


3.  And if there is ever a still moment for **reflective thought** — say, while waiting in line at the grocery store or sitting in traffic — out comes the mobile device. So it’s worth noting a study published last month in the journal Science, which shows how far [people will go to avoid introspection](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6192/75).

4.  “We had noted **how wedded to** our devices we all seem to be and that people seem to find any excuse they can to keep busy,” said Timothy Wilson, a **psychology** professor at the University of Virginia and lead author of the study. “No one had done a simple study letting people go off on their own and think.”

>-  how wedded to   粘在
>- psychology  心理学

5.  The results surprised him and have **created a stir** in the psychology and **neuroscience** communities. In 11 experiments involving more than 700 people, the majority of **participants** reported that they found it unpleasant to be alone in a room with their thoughts for just 6 to 15 minutes.

>- created to stir : led to lot of interest or exitment
>- Neuroscience：神经系统科学
>- Participant：参与者

6.  Moreover, in one experiment, 64 percent of men and 15 percent of women began self-administering electric shocks when left alone to think. These same people, by the way, had previously said they would pay money to avoid receiving the painful **jolt**.

>- jolt: 震惊


7.  It didn’t matter if the subjects engaged in the **contemplative** exercise at home or in the laboratory, or if they were given suggestions of what to think about, like a coming vacation; they just didn’t like being in their own heads.

>- Contemplative：冥想的


8.  It could be because human beings, when left alone, **tend to dwell on** what’s wrong in their lives. We have evolved to become problem solvers and meaning makers. What **preys on our minds**, when we aren’t updating our Facebook page or in **spinning class**, are the things we haven’t figured out — difficult relationships, personal and professional failures, money trouble, health concerns and so on. And until there is resolution, or at least some kind of understanding or acceptance, these thoughts **reverberate** in our heads. Hello rumination. Hello insomnia.

>- dwell on : to think a lot about sth
>- prey on one's mind: to make sb think or worry about sth all the time
>- reverberate: 回荡


9.  “One explanation why people keep themselves so busy and would rather shock themselves is that they are trying to avoid that kind of negative stuff,” said Ethan Kross, director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory at the University of Michigan. “It doesn’t feel good if you’re not **intrinsically** good at reflecting.”

>- intrinsically: 本质上的


10. The comedian [Louis C.K.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HbYScltf1c&feature=kp) has a **riff** that’s been watched nearly eight million times on YouTube in which he describes that not-good feeling. “Sometimes when things clear away and you’re not watching anything and you’re in your car and you start going, oh no, here it comes, that I’m alone, and it starts to visit on you, just this sadness,” he said. “And that’s why we text and drive. People are willing to risk taking a life and ruining their own because they don’t want to be alone for a second because it’s so hard.”

>- riff: 即兴表演


11. But you can’t solve or let go of problems if you don’t allow yourself time to think about them. **It’s an imperative ignored by our culture, which values doing more than thinking and believes answers are in the palm of your hand rather than in your own head.**


>- imperative: 至关重要的事


12. “It’s like we’re all in this addicted family where all this busyness seems normal when it’s really harmful,” said Stephanie Brown, a psychologist in Silicon Valley and the author of “Speed: Facing Our Addiction to Fast and Faster — and Overcoming Our Fear of Slowing Down.” “There’s this widespread belief that thinking and feeling will only slow you down and **get in your way**, but it’s the opposite.”

>- get in one's way: 挡住某人的路


13. Suppressing negative feelings only gives them more power, she said, leading to **intrusive** thoughts, which makes people get even busier to keep them **at bay**. The constant cognitive strain of evading emotions underlies a range of psychological troubles such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression and panic attacks, not to mention a range of addictions. It is also associated with various somatic problems like eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, inflammation, impaired immunity and headaches.

>- suppress: 抑制
>- intrusive：强加的
>- be at bay: 走投无路  cornered


14. Studies further suggest that not giving yourself time to reflect [impairs your ability to empathize](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976340900195X) with others. “The more in touch with my own feelings and experiences, the richer and more accurate are my guesses of what passes through another person’s mind,” said Giancarlo Dimaggio, a psychiatrist with the Center for Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy in Rome, who studies the interplay of self-reflection and empathy. “Feeling what you feel is an ability that atrophies if you don’t use it.”

15. Researchers have also found that an idle mind is a crucible of creativity. A number of studies have shown that people tend to come up with more novel uses for objects if they are first given an easy task that [allows their minds to wander](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/31/0956797612446024.abstract), rather than a more demanding one.

16. “Idle mental processing encourages creativity and solutions because imagining your problem when you aren’t in it is not the same as reality,” said Jonathan Smallwood, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, in England. “Using your imagination means you are in fact rethinking the problem in a **novel** way.”

17. Perhaps that’s why Google offers its employees courses called “Search Inside Yourself” and “Neural Self-Hacking,” which include instruction on mindfulness meditation, where the goal is to recognize and accept inner thoughts and feelings rather than ignore or **repress** them. It’s in the company’s interest because it frees up employees’ otherwise **embattled** brain space to intuit end users’ desires and create products to satisfy them.

>- repress: 抑制
>- embattled: 部署

18. “I have a lot of people who come in and want to learn meditation to shut out thoughts that come up in those quiet moments,” said Sarah Griesemer, a psychologist in Austin, Tex., who **incorporates** mindfulness meditation into her practice. “But allowing and tolerating the drifting in of thoughts is part of the process.” Her patients, mostly **hard-charging** professionals, report being more productive at work and more energetic and engaged parents.

>- incorporate: 包含/吸收
>- hard-charging: very aggressive, determined, or ambitious

19. To **get rid of** the emotional static, experts advise [not using first-person pronouns](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/2/304/) when thinking about troubling events in your life. Instead, use third-person pronouns or your own name when thinking about yourself. “If a friend comes to you with a problem it’s easy to coach them through it, but if the problem is happening to us we have real difficulty, **in part** because we have all these **egocentric** biases making it hard to reason rationally,” said Dr. Kross of Michigan. “The data clearly shows that you can use language to almost trick yourself into thinking your problems are happening to someone else.”


>- get rid of: 除去
>- in part: to some extend; partly
>- egocentric: 自我为中心的


20. Hard as they sometimes are, negative feelings are a part of everyone’s life, arguably more so if you are crazy busy. But it’s those same deep and troubling feelings, and how you deal with them, that make you the person you are. While busyness may **stanch** welling sadness, it may also limit your ability to **be overcome with joy**.

>- stanch:  止住
>- welling: 涌出的
>- be overcome with joy：极度喜悦

**长难句**

We had noted how wedded to our devices we all seem to be and that people seem to find any excuse they can to keep busy.

>我们可以发现人们是多么的粘自己的手机，而且会极尽所能想出来各种理由让自己忙起来。Note 后面跟着两个并列的宾语从句，而第二个宾语从句要由 that 的出现来引导， 原来的陈述句是：we all seem to be (how wedded) to our devices

And until there is resolution, or at least some kind of understanding or acceptance, these thoughts reverberate in our heads.

>而且，我们（如果是）找不到解决办法或者想不通这些闹心的事儿的话，这些问题就会一直回荡在我们脑海里。Reverberate = won’t disappear or fade away

Suppressing negative feelings only gives them more power, she said, leading to intrusive thoughts, which makes people get even busier to keep them at bay.

>她还说，“你刻意的去抑制负面的情绪只能让它滋生出更大的影响，带来更多的想法，而这些随之而来的想法会让你变得更忙，忙到不可开交忙到走投无路。” She said 是插入语，leading（非谓语动词）引导的一个伴随（表目的）状语， intrusive thoughts 强加过来的思绪，which 引导非限定性定语从句，这些强加过来的思绪会让他们更忙，忙到走投无路。

The constant cognitive strain of evading emotions underlies a range of psychological troubles such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression and panic attacks, not to mention a range of addictions.

>逃避情绪所带来的不断的认知性的负担正是造成一系列心理问题的根源，譬如说，强迫症/焦虑/抑郁以及恐惧症，更别说一系列的瘾性疾病。主句谓语是 underlie ——导致/造成，也就是 A 会造成 B，A 的核心词是 strain —— 负担压力，B 的核心词是 troubles。进一步分析，在 A 里面，什么样的负担压力呢？注意，of 这个单词给人的感觉呢是一种所属或者源于的感觉（used to show possession, belonging, or origin），那在这儿我们就把 strain 理解为源于 evading emotions 了，也就是说 evading emotions 导致的/带来的 strain。B 就很简单了，一系列的心理问题，such as 比如说而最后的 not to mention 表示地强调啊。成瘾性的症状就更容易导致了。

Hard as they sometimes are, negative feelings are a part of everyone’s life, arguably more so if you are crazy busy. But it’s those same deep and troubling feelings, and how you deal with them, that make you the person you are. While busyness may stanch welling sadness, it may also limit your ability to be overcome with joy.

>负面情绪作为我们每个人生活中的一部分啊，有时候确实挺麻烦，尤其是我们超级忙的时候，更是如此。但正是这些幽深的烦人的感觉，以及我们如何去处理它造就我们。当忙碌止住了满意出的悲伤时，它也同样限制了我们被喜悦充盈的能力。Hard 引导的让步状语，尽管怎么样，坏情绪就是一生伴随，甩不掉的。It is A that B，这是一个句型，是 A（做了）B 这事儿，表强调。While 可以理解为伴随状语。
