1.  Another week, and yet another Asian business leader finds himself in <u>bear-like ~~hug~~ embrace</u> of the US President-elect Donald Trump.

2.  This time it is China's Jack Ma - the founder of Alibaba.

##  On the face of it they're an unlikely pairing.

3.  One's been raised in the lap of luxury, the other had humble beginnings. One has taken advantage of the free market capitalism of the West, the other grew up in the Chinese Communist system.

4.  But there are a few things they have in common.

- on the face of  显然 or 表面看起来

> - On the face of it apperently as it seems.
> - His statement that he is a millionaire is, on the face of it, false.
> - On the face of it, his theory is OK, but we still have to wait and see how it works in practice.


> - Lynn made it to the top in a perfact pairing of Hollywood and science.
> - On the face of it, they're an unlikely pairing, but they are getting married soon.


## They both think huge

5.  It is possibly Donald Trump's favourite word: Huge. And whatever you might think of him, the President-elect certainly has had grand plans. Taking over his father's real estate business and turning it an <u>empire</u>. Expanding it into an entertainment business. Running for, and winning, the highest office in the land. There's no lack of ambition. He's now thought to be worth almost $4bn (although consistently claims he's worth more than double that).

- the highest office
- in office

6.  When it comes to wealth, China's Jack Ma isn't far behind. He is China's third richest man and Forbes names him amongst the most powerful people on the planet. But he started his professional life teaching English to students in a university in a small Chinese town, reportedly making about US$12 a month. To get better at English, he would court foreign tourists, charming them into having conversations at local hotels. He started the <u>e-commerce giant</u> Alibaba in his flat, and hasn't looked back.

- court
- charming


7.  Mr Ma also has a grand vision which has driven the company from the start: to create ten million profitable businesses and 100 million jobs in the next 20 years.


- think huge
- have grand plans
- ambitious
- have a grand vision


## They aren't afraid to take risks

8.  Both men are known risk-takers, or as some would say, gamblers.

9.  And perhaps Mr Trump's biggest gamble was **running for president**. He was initially seen as the weakest contender during the campaign for the Republican nomination. But a decision to take a risk and be outrageous helped him, in part at least, to get his name on the **ballot** paper and ultimately to win the presidency.

10. Jack Ma is similarly unafraid to take risks. One of his early internet ventures, China Pages, ended badly when he ended up having to form a joint venture with China Telecom and lost control of the company. He also burned through a lot of cash in his early days, and at one point had to lay off all of his international staff. But Mr Ma, who was once rejected from a managerial role at a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Hangzhou, says **he wouldn't be where he is today without having to learn to deal with failure.**

- burn through


## They embrace their inner crazy

11. Mr Trump is known as one of America's most colourful and famous billionaires. He **rose to fame** as the boss in the hit television show "The Apprentice" and his trademark "You're Fired" became a catchphrase. **But eccentric, and many would say outrageous, comments on the campaign trail have also led to him being called crazy by his critics, for all the wrong reasons.** Remember when he said he would impose a total "shutdown" of Muslims entering the United States? Or how about the the pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and get the US's neighbour to pay for it? **The list goes on**.

- rose to fame
- catchphrase 流行语

12. Mr Ma is often called "Crazy Jack" (though that craziness isn't seen as offensive.).

13. His trademark speeches **captivate** and inspire employees. He is a showman who regularly entertains Alibaba staff with performances that would make Justin Timberlake proud. He's a familiar smiling face on the televised galas launching Alibaba's Singles Day sales, and is also known to **preside over** mass marriages at the firm.


## The Buddy economy

14. Almost every time a billionaire goes through the doors of Trump Towers, the President-elect comes out with a pledge to create jobs in the US. It is starting to be seen as a fast-pass route to getting business done - as I wrote about when Japan's Masayoshi Son met with Mr Trump late last year.

15. His meeting with Jack Ma was no different.

16. And while the practice of business leaders visiting publicly-elected officials might have many **scratching their heads** in Western nations, the relationship between business and politics is much closer in many parts of Asia - including China. So this is a way of doing business that Mr Ma will know and understand well.


> A lot of people


17. China-US relations may well deteriorate after January 20, when Mr Trump has promised to call China out as a currency manipulator, Mr Ma is making sure that his personal relationship with the new president isn't affected - which can only be good for his business

## Alibaba's 1 million American jobs promise isn't realistic

18. Alibaba founder Jack Ma met with Donald Trump Monday and pledged to create one million jobs in the U.S. over the next five years through the company's e-commerce platform.

19. That is a vague and misleading promise.

20. Ma is not going to build factories. He is not planning to set up Alibaba operations centers that would employ tech **savvy** Americans. And he is not touting a big investment in the U.S.

- savvy  领悟高的  Do you savvy



21. In other words, Ma isn't promising what most experts and economists would define as job creation. He's talking about stimulating trade by helping one million small businesses sell American goods to consumers in China and Asia.

22. To create one million jobs would require each of those businesses to hire one new worker. So far so good. But U.S. trade on Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall shopping sites is relatively small at the moment. More than 7,000 U.S. brands sold $15 billion worth of goods to Chinese consumers last year, according to Alibaba spokesperson Rico Ngai. (Alibaba did $17.8 billion in sales in 24 hours during its online shopping bonanza in November.)

23. Ma has been pushing since 2015 to increase U.S. sales to China on Alibaba. But getting one million American brands onto its platforms would require a 142-fold increase in business.

  </span>
  <span><span class="word-node">many</span> <span class="word-node">would</span> <span class="word-node">say</span>
  </span>
  <span>是修饰
  </span>
  <span><span class="word-node">outrageous</span>
  </span>
  <span>的。
  </span>
  <br>
  <span style="background:lightgray"><span class="word-node">on</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">campaign</span> <span class="word-node">trail</span>

  <span><span class="word-node">comments</span>
  </span>
  <span>。
  </span>
  <br>
  <span style="background:lightgray"><span class="word-node">by</span> <span class="word-node">his</span> <span class="word-node">critics</span>

  </span>
  <span><span class="word-node">being</span> <span class="word-node">called</span> <span class="word-node">crazy</span>
  </span>
  <span>的动作发出者。
  </span>
  <br>
  <span style="background:darkgray;"><span class="word-node">for</span> <span class="word-node">all</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">wrong</span> <span class="word-node">reasons</span>
  </span>
  <span>
    介词短语依然是修饰语，表明疯狂的评价是负面的。
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  这句话主干其实就说了一件事，comments <span class="word-node">have</span> <span class="word-node">also</span> <span class="word-node">led</span> <span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">him</span> <span class="word-node">being</span> <span class="word-node">called</span> <span class="word-node">crazy</span> <span class="word-node">by</span> <span class="word-node">his</span> <span class="word-node">critics</span>。关键的是要搞清楚形容词修饰的是什么？在看修饰的时候，一般就是找其距离最近的对象，那也就是comments，而comments也正是这句话的主语，因此这句话应该这样理解，他在竞选过程中eccentric 和outrageous的评论使得critics认为他很疯狂，但是这点奇怪了，for <span class="word-node">all</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">wrong</span> <span class="word-node">reasons</span>，这个是什么意思？难道其实川普不疯狂，并不是，有时候我们说一个人疯狂，可能是褒义，比如这个人他不拘泥于框架，但这里评论川普疯狂是说疯的不对，狂的有错，不是正向的评价；随后列举了一些他的政治思想以进行佐证。比如禁止Muslims也就是穆斯林进入美国领土，或者在与墨西哥的交界处建造一个高高的围墙，而且还要人家付钱等等等等。</p>

</p>
  <p>这句话暴长有没有，不慌，我们来精简一下。前面是while引导的从句对吧，我们首先看主句，the <span class="word-node">relationship</span> <span class="word-node">between</span> <span class="word-node">business</span> <span class="word-node">and</span> <span class="word-node">politics</span> <span class="word-node">is</span> <span class="word-node">much</span> <span class="word-node">closer</span> <span class="word-node">in</span> <span class="word-node">many</span> <span class="word-node">parts</span> <span class="word-node">of</span> <span class="word-node">Asia</span> - <span class="word-node">including</span> <span class="word-node">China</span>.主干就说这么个事，到底是谁的关系更近了呢，美国与亚洲包括中国的政商关系，主句就讲了这么个事情。接着我们看从句，while表示让步对吧，从句说这种商界领导会见政府官员的行为会使得很多西方国家scratching <span class="word-node">their</span> <span class="word-node">heads</span>，头痒痒，也就是不舒服喽，但是其实政商关系是更亲近了对不对。</p>

</p>

<p>这个句子是一个合句，由两个单句构成，每个单句另带有从句，看起来复杂，其实很简单，我们分开来分析。首先第一个单句，SVO为China-US <span class="word-node">relations</span> <span class="word-node">may</span> <span class="word-node">well</span> <span class="word-node">deteriorate</span>，后面after是介词短语，介词短语时什么？表修饰的对不对，其后跟了when引导的时间状语从句，从句中很简单，不过多分析；我们继续看后面的一个单句，单句中出现了that对吧，that引导的是宾语从句，主干其实就是Mr. <span class="word-node">Ma</span> <span class="word-node">is</span> <span class="word-node">making</span> <span class="word-node">sure</span> <span class="word-node">sth</span>。Sth用一个句子阐述，后面出现了破折号，破折号表示什么，补充说明对吧，这里是一个which引导的定语从句修饰前面马云确定的那一件事情，补充说明其效用。
