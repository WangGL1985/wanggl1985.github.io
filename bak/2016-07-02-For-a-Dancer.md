Because Jackson Browne[^1] and his music seem to occupy a special place among Rolling Stone readers, a brief introductory note should suffice. Why Browne is special is probably a personal thing, but I've always suspected that those of us who admire his admittedly autobiographical art usually find in it more about our own lives — not Jackson's — than we'd care to convey. In the Sixties, Bob Dylan had an uncanny ability to define a decade and its denizens. Throughout the Seventies and into the Eighties — for me, at least — Jackson Browne has taken over this job and done it better than anyone else.

With the release of Hold Out, his sixth album in eight years, Browne has just begun the most extensive tour of his career. Right before he hit the road, Jackson managed a few free hours to tape this interview. We talked twice — each time at the ungodly hour of nine in the morning — before he had to rush off to rehearsals, photo sessions and so forth. Since we'd done stories together in the past (for The Pretender and Running on Empty), both of us knew what to expect. I knew he'd do his damnedest to avoid explaining what his new songs meant, and he knew I'd attempt to drag it out of him. The give-and-take was pretty funny at times.

When I arrived fifteen minutes early for our last taping and knocked on the door of Browne's modest Hollywood home, the house was silent. I leaned on the doorbell for what seemed like forever. Finally, Ethan, Jackson's six-year-old son, opened the gate and let me in. "Who are you?" he asked. I told him who I was and that I had an important appointment with his father. "He's still asleep," Ethan said. "But you can come in and help me find the can opener. I've got to feed the cat." We fed the cat. Ethan asked: "Do you want to see me stand on my head?" Sure, why not, I thought, praying that Jackson would wake up. I could feel my interview going down the drain.
