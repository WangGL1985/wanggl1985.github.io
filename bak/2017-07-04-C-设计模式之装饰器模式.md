Imagine you run a car service shop offering mulriple services. Now how to do you calculate the bill to be charged? you pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.


Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.


In OOP , the decorator pattern is a pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
