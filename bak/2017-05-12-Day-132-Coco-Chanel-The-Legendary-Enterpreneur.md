“In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different.”

[1] Between creativity and classical style, Coco set herself as a fashion myth. As she created “Chanel,” Coco also created the woman of the twentieth century century, up-to-the minute, liberated, and elegant at the same time. An à la française luxury. **To Coco Chanel, lux unsurprisingly imposed itself, as an opposite not to poverty, but to vulgarity**. Moreover, some great achievements come out of great grief. Coco Chanel’s mom died when she was 12 and her father left his children and traveled to America. At 20, Coco left the orphan and found a job as a seller in a small baby clothes shop at Moulins… By that time, who of her customers would have ever imagined that the young Gabrielle will become a worldwide luxury brand setter and one of <u>the 100 influencing women</u> of the twentieth-century?

### A typical illustration of an entrepreneur: rebellious and determined

Gabrielle always thought that life must have something else to offer her; she decided to live in her own studio and did everything she could do to pay the rent; stitching, cleaning, and singing at the Rotonde café. Gabrielle’s famous répertoire was limited to two songs: “Ko Ko Ri Ko” and “Qui qu’a vu Coco dans l’Trocadéro.” Those two songs were more **acclaimed** for Gabrielle’s charms rather than for her voice. “Coco,” the name, was born.

### Vision-oriented

“A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous.” – Coco Chanel

Coco created “la petite robe noire,” the tiny black dress, which reflected Chanel’s sober style. The American edition of Vogue elected it in 1925 as the dress to wear for any **occasions**. “A women who doesn’t wear perfume has no future.” Coco Chanel Creative and innovative, Coco Chanel was the first needlewoman who created a perfume labelled in her name: “Chanel N˚5.” Not only did she create a new idea, but she also innovated in the perfume mixture; it included synthetic ingredients that could enhance her outfits. All other perfumes were only based on natural substances, which used to evaporate fast. Also, the perfume bottle shape was different from all other perfume brands’ and reflected Chanel’s sober wears. The **fragrance** profits went up to 15 million US dollars.

### Passionate

“There is no time for cut-and-dried **monotony**. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time!” – Coco Chanel

### Great decision maker

“Women must always tell men that they are the strong ones. They are the big, the strong, and the wonderful. In truth, women are the strong ones. It is just my opinion, I am not a professor.” – Coco Chanel

### Team builder

After Chanel’s simple yet classy hats became popular with French women, Chanel used a location at Malsherbes, then opened a saloon in Gabon Street and three years later another hats boutique in Deauville’s luxurious seaside resort… After the help of her aunt and sister, Chanel tremendously increased the number of her employees.

### Leader

“A leader knows the way, shows the way, and goes the way.” In her **atelier**, Coco Chanel was a worker, not an artist. She didn’t use pens and her mockups weren’t done on paper but on **mannequins**, with real clothes. Until her death on January 10th, 1971, Coco went from needlewoman to “The Queen of the Parisian Haute Couture.”

> A mannequin is a life-sized model of a person which is used to display clothes, especially in shop windows.

### Creating followers

Coco Chanel set herself as the leader in fashion. At 70, after her numerous ups and downs in her personal life as well as in her national belonging and obstacles in her career, she reinvented elegance. The Chanel suit was adopted by Romy Schneider, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Shirley MacLaine.

### Innate character

“Nature gives you the face you have at twenty; it is up to you to **merit** the face you have at fifty.” – Coco Chanel

> If someone or something merits a particular action or treatment, they deserve it.

After the needlewomen in her atelier participated in the big strike of 1936, Chanel showed no mercy nor understanding to them. On the contrary. She unmasked deception and indignation.

### Enjoying every single step

“A woman has the age she deserves.” – Coco Chanel

**Coco Chanel lived her life to the fullest, loving, falling in love, again and again, but mostly with her work… It happened she loved it the most… and it must have loved her in return.**

### Taking the right decisions

“Don’t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.” – Coco Chanel

Coco always knew what she wanted, and still, she had a vision and knew just which road to follow in order to get to her aim.

### Plan everything

“Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury.” – Coco Chanel

Coco came up with the idea of setting women free of lace, pearls, nodes, and frills. Her style was worth a thousand words; she created an all-new modern woman, liberated, self-confident, and free. She imagined her style, concretized it, and wore it. Her creations mirrored simplicity yet elegance.

### Manage money wisely

“There are people who have money and people who are rich.” – Coco Chanel

Coco’s richness was native elegance… And so, Chanel’s followers must have this inner je-nesais- quoi that distinguishes them from all other trend followers… There are some things money can’t buy… the way to wear numerous necklaces of white pearls for instance.

### Public Speaking

“As long as you know men are like children, you know everything!” – Coco Chanel

Coco Chanel made some arrogant, not to say dangerous statements by that time… Self-confidence was her inner strength, and she said out loud what so many women kept in their hearts for long and never had the courage to divulge.

### Selling… with art

“Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.” – Coco Chanel

### Managing Time and planning Finances

“Elegance does not consist in putting on a new dress.” – Coco Chanel

It’s all well said and set… Elegance is a style… and a way of living. Instead of buying new dresses, Chanel started to cut back on time and money by changing dresses throughout adding–and mostly removing- some details… as well as embellishing outfits with simplicity.

### Dealing with Criticism

“The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.” – Coco Chanel
