##### OUR MISSION

As a global educational institution with a pioneering multi-campus model, our mission is to create an open-minded learning environment that brings together people, cultures and ideas from around the world, in order to transform individuals and organisations through business education. Through teaching, we develop responsible, thoughtful leaders and entrepreneurs who create value for their organisations and their communities. Through research, we expand the frontiers of knowledge and influence business practice.

##### OUR VALUES

**Diversity as a source of learning and enrichment **

We are free from any dominant culture or prevalent dogma; we are open to, and respectful of, other views; we learn through the exchange of ideas and experiences.

**Independence as a governance principle **

We believe in intellectual freedom and are autonomous in our financial, institutional and academic planning and decision-making process.

**Rigor and relevance in teaching and research **

We encourage diversity in research and teaching methods with no single school of thought or methodology predominating; what matters is rigor and impact on management as an academic discipline, on business practice, and in the classroom.

**Closeness to the international business community **

We partner with the international business community to explore and disseminate management knowledge; we believe in the role of business as a force for improving people's lives.

**Entrepreneurial spirit **

We are willing to experiment and innovate; we are ready to take risks and manage the results of our actions.
