**Respect**

We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves. We do not tolerate **abusive** or disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance don't belong here.

<!-- more -->

- Someone who is abusive behaves in a cruel and violent way towards other people.
- the quality of lacking pity or compassion for others: the real-world ruthlessness of business.
- insensitive and cruel disregard for others: the callousness of using children to send a political message.
- the quality of being arrogant: the arrogance of this man is astounding.
**Integrity**

We work with customers and prospects openly, honestly, and sincerely. When we say we will do something, we will do it; when we say we cannot or will not do something, then we won't do it.

**Communication**

We have an obligation to communicate. Here, we take the time to talk with one another and to listen. We believe that information is meant to move and that information moves people.

**Excellence**

We are satisfied with nothing less than the very best ineverything we do. We will continue to raise the bar for everyone. The great fun here will be for all of us to discover just how good we can really be.

Enron stands on the foundation of its vision and values. Every employee is educated about the Company's vision and values and is expected to conduct business with other employees, partners, contractors, suppliers, vendors, and customers keeping in mind respect, integrity, communication, and excellence. Everything we do evolves from Enron's vision and values statements.

At Enron, we treat others as we expect to be treated ourselves. We believe in respect for the rights of all individuals and are committed to promoting an environment characterised by dignity and mutual respect for employees, customers, contractors, suppliers, partners, community members, and representatives of all levels of government.
