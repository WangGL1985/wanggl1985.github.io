Chrystia Freeland, a journalist-turned-politician, **frets about** the rise of the “new global super-rich” and the fall of everyone else. Charles Murray, America’s gloomiest social scientist, **warns that** society is “coming apart” as the rich retreat into their gated communities.

- lament [ləˈment]
  - vt. 悲叹; 悔恨; 痛惜; （为…） 哀悼;
  - n. 哀歌，挽歌; 悲恸，恸哭; 悲痛之情; 悼词;
> Ken began to lament the death of his only son

- inequality [ˌɪnɪˈkwɒləti] n. 不平等，不均等; [数] 不等式; 变动，变化; 不相同;
> People are concerned about social inequality.

- stagnation [stæɡ’neɪʃn] n. 滞止; 淤塞，停滞; 不景气;
> Stagnation in home sales is holding back economic recovery

- authority [ɔ:ˈθɒrəti] n. 权威; 权力; 学术权威; [复数] 当权者;

- fret about  担心

  - n. 撤回; 静居处; 引退期间; 静思，静修;
> ‘I’ve already got a job,’ I said quickly, and retreated from the room.

主语是一个 `doing` 结构 `lamenting the rise of inequality`，其中 `lamenting` 这个词意思是（为。。。）而悲伤，哀伤，此处为唱衰。我们来看这里说这个行业 (one of the few growth industries) 现在的状态是 `in an age of stagnation`。其中 `Stagnation` 是不景气的意思。比如我们想说现在经济不景气就可以直接说 `our economy is in an age of stagnation`。

其实第一句话说的意思就是为上升的不平等性唱哀歌这样的一个增长性行业目前也处于一个不景气的状态。


2.  At the top of the income scale, however, a small counter-trend is observable. Never before have so many people been able to get access to the accoutrements of tycoonery—private planes, luxury yachts, fancy cars and interior-designed, exclusive homes. <span style="color:black"><span style="background:red"><span class="word-node">There</span> <span class="word-node">is</span> <span class="word-node">only</span> <span class="word-node">so</span> <span class="word-node">much</span> <span class="word-node">comfort</span> <span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">be</span> <span class="word-node">had</span> <span class="word-node">from</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">fact</span></span> <span class="word-node">that</span> <span style="background:aqua"><span class="word-node">it</span></span> <span class="word-node">is</span> <span class="word-node">easier</span> <span class="word-node">for</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">merely</span> <span class="word-node">rich</span> <span style="background:aqua"><span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">lay</span> <span class="word-node">claim</span></span> <span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">lifestyle</span> <span class="word-node">of</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">super</span>-rich.</span> But as a result of a combination of new technologies and businesses, that is nonetheless what is happening.

>He is already a member of Britain’s most exclusive club


`There is only so much comfort to be had from the fact` 想想就很爽这样的感觉是不是？`it is easier for the merely rich to lay claim to the lifestyle of the super-rich` 对于一般有钱的人，对超级巨富的生活方式进行评价变得更加容易了，这句话表面意思好像是这样，其实深层含义是体验超级巨富的生活方式变得更加容易了。`Lay claim to sth，`体验过才有资格和能力评价嘛。


3.  Tycoon living begins with a private jet. Whereas yachts are dispensable (not everyone wants to float around for weeks with the same dinner companions) private jets are necessities for the aspiring billionaire. They save time. Even first-class passengers have to wait an hour or so for their flights. Private-jet owners can turn up when they want. The planes can double as flying offices, and you don’t have to worry about other passengers eavesdropping on your deals or objecting to your spreading papers. The flight is smoother (private jets typically fly at 45,000 feet), the seats are more throne-like, and you can bring your pets.


- dispensable[dɪˈspensəbl] adj. 非必需的，可省去的; 不必要;
>All those people in the middle are dispensable.

- necessities 英[nɪ’sesɪtɪz] n. 必需品; 必要（性）( necessity的名词复数 ); （迫切） 需要; 自然规律;
>Truckloads of food, blankets, and other necessities reached the city.

- aspiring [əˈspaɪərɪŋ]

  - n. 偷听;
  - v. 偷听（别人的谈话）( eavesdrop的现在分词 );
>Don’t you know I could have you arrested for eavesdropping?


4.  No longer do you need a net worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars to have one. With 700 jets, NetJets is now the fifth-largest airline by number of planes, after Southwest Airlines, and it has access to thousands of private airports. Its main innovation was to apply the principle of fractional ownership, or time-sharing, to the ultimate executive tool. Customers buy a share in a jet which entitles them to, say, 200 hours of travel a year.


- innovation [ˌɪnəˈveɪʃn] n. 改革，创新; 新观念; 新发明; 新设施;
>The vegetarian burger was an innovation which was rapidly exported to Britain.

- fractional[ˈfrækʃənl] adj. [数] 分数的，小数的; 微小的，极小的; 部分的，少量的; 零碎的;

5.  <span style="color:black"><span style="background:red"><span class="word-node">NetJets</span> <span class="word-node">is</span> <span class="word-node">skilled</span> <span class="word-node">at</span> <span class="word-node">providing</span></span> <span class="word-node">its</span> <span class="word-node">rich</span> <span class="word-node">clients</span> <span style="background:red"><span class="word-node">with</span></span> <span class="word-node">an</span> <span class="word-node">entr</span>ée <span style="background:lightgray"><span class="word-node">into</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">cultural</span> <span class="word-node">world</span> <span class="word-node">of</span> <span class="word-node">the</span> <span class="word-node">super</span>-rich</span>, <span style="background:darkgray"><span class="word-node">with</span> <span class="word-node">hard</span>-to-get <span class="word-node">tickets</span></span> <span style="background:aqua"><span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">events</span></span> <span style="background:lightgray"><span class="word-node">such</span> <span class="word-node">as</span> <span class="word-node">Art</span> <span class="word-node">Basel</span>, <span class="word-node">a</span> <span class="word-node">series</span> <span class="word-node">of</span> <span class="word-node">art</span> <span class="word-node">fairs</span></span>, <span style="background:aqua"><span class="word-node">and</span></span> <span style="background:aqua"><span class="word-node">to</span> <span class="word-node">private</span> <span class="word-node">dinners</span></span> <span style="background:lightgray"><span class="word-node">with</span> <span class="word-node">celebrities</span>.</span></span> The company is also finding ways to bring down the cost: one of its latest ideas is the private-jet equivalent of London Underground’s electronic ticket, the Oyster card. Rather than buying a share in a jet you can buy a pre-paid card that entitles you to a certain number of flying hours a year, with 25 hours’ worth of flights adding up to about €155,000 ($163,435).

- client [ˈklaɪənt]n. 顾客; 当事人; 诉讼委托人; [计算机] 客户端;
>The company required clients to pay substantial fees in advance.

- entrée  f.  进口； 进气口； 进气管； 门厅； 入口； 输入端； 输入； 引进

>The Basel Committee accepted this.

- celebrity[səˈlebrəti] n. 名流; 名声; 名人，知名人士; 名誉;
>In 1944, at the age of 30, Hersey suddenly became a celebrity.

- equivalent [ɪˈkwɪvələnt]
  - adj. 相等的，相当的，等效的; 等价的，等积的; [化学] 当量的;
  - n. 对等物; [化学] 当量;
>The equivalent of two tablespoons of polyunsaturated oils is ample each day

- oyster[ˈɔɪstə(r)] n. 牡蛎; <俚>守秘密的人; 鸡背肉; 沉默寡言的人;
>He had two dozen oysters and enjoyed every one of them.


首先分析一下这个句子的架构，`Be skilled at` 很擅长作某事；`Provide sb with sth` 为某人提供某物。句子主干部分是：`NetJets is skilled at providing its rich clients with hard-to-get tickets` 是 `with an entrée` 的同位语。`to events` 和` to private dinners` 两个介词短语并列修饰 `tickets`。`NetJets` 这公司还帮助它富有的客户进入超级巨富的 `culture world` 。 给自己客户搞一些很难搞定的入场券 `hard-to-get tickets` 很难搞到的票.

6.  The sharing economy was hardly inspired by the needs of the rich. But in some ways it suits them perfectly. The whole idea depends on people having spare assets that they are willing to rent out to total strangers. Who has more idle assets than the super-rich? And who loves extra income more than people who have spent their lives accumulating money? On the other side of the market, bustling plutocrats are an ever-present source of demand for temporary accommodation and bursts of luxury. The system can even have a strange public-relations benefit. A wealthy boss who makes use of NetJets won’t need to explain to his shareholders why he bought a jet, even as he treats the one he flies on as though it were his own.

7.  Uber, a ride-hailing firm, and Airbnb, an accommodation-sharing service, are prominent in the luxury market as well as the mass market. Uber offers yacht trips in Dubai (UberYacht) and helicopter commutes in São Paulo (UberCopter). Airbnb does a booming trade in luxury apartments in London, Hong Kong and the Caribbean. There are providers in almost every cranny of the luxury landscape. GetMyBoat, a San Francisco-based company, gives customers access to motorboats, luxury houseboats, yachts and jet skis in 7,100 places around the world. Stratajet sells tickets on empty legs on private jets for the price of a business-class ticket or even less. Staller, which describes itself as the “Airbnb for horses”, helps horse-owners rent stalls near equestrian competitions. A home-sharing club called ThirdHome.com allows people with just a couple of homes to live as if they have a dozen.

9.  Methods of managing wealth as well as consuming it are trickling down. Until recently only people called Rockefeller and Morgan could afford so-called “family offices” that manage their investments, taxes and charitable giving (and get entry into the best hedge funds). Now people with as little as $5m to invest can afford to do so thanks to a boom in so-called “multi-family” offices. Banks such as Citigroup have set up multi-family divisions. Even blue-blooded wealth advisers such as Rockefeller Co, in Manhattan, are offering family-office services to the “merely” crowd.

10. That things are getting better for more rich people does not contradict Mr Frank’s broader worry, but among the Art Basel class it is a notable shift. Once upon a time you had to be born rich to join the global elite. Then you had to make a hundred million dollars, and then the threshold rose to a billion. Now goods and services that used to be confined to a handful of tycoons are available to the millionaire or pretend-millionaire next door, thanks to the magic of the sharing economy. The super-rich may be floating off into their own country. But more people can join them, even if temporarily, than ever before.
