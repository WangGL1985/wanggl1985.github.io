# CHAPTER 2

## Do You Know Where Your Goals Come From?

<!-- more -->
**NOT ALL GOALS ARE CREATED EQUAL.** AND EVEN TWO PEOPLE WHO seem to be working toward the same goal, like having a successful career, often have very different goals in mind. That’s because success at work can be about many things, depending on the person—it can be about gaining security, or validation, or glory, or perhaps even personal growth, just to name a few of the possibilities. **Some kinds of goals seem to lead to lasting improvements in happiness and well-being, while for others the changes are fleeting, if they happen at all.** When you are coping with great difficulty or something really challenging, there are goals that will naturally lead to hard work and persistence, and others that are often a recipe for helplessness and depression.

**Achieving isn’t just about knowing how to reach your goals—it’s at least as much about pursuing the kinds of goals that will help you to develop your full potential and actually enjoy the process of getting there.** But before I tell you in the coming chapters about how and why goals differ, which ones will work best for you, and how you can change your goals (or change other people’s goals), it’s helpful to start by understanding where the goals you already have came from. Knowing why you’ve made the choices you’ve made in the past makes you better able to reevaluate them honestly and objectively, and frees you to make different choices from now on.

It won’t surprise you to learn that your beliefs are important influences on the goals you adopt. For instance, you would probably only commit to the goal of improving your math skills if you believe that math skills can be improved in the first place—otherwise it just wouldn’t make sense to try. **Our beliefs determine whether we see a goal as within our reach or as a waste of time and energy.** So I’ll be focusing on a few of the common beliefs people hold that have a lot of influence on our goals. You’ll see how these beliefs may have shaped your own choices in the past. And you’ll find out that some of those beliefs—ones you yourself may hold—are, to put it bluntly, just plain wrong.

It probably will surprise you to learn that the other major influence on the goals you adopt is your environment, and that its influence is almost always unconscious. In other words, throughout your day you are actively pursuing goals you may not even know you have—goals that have been triggered by signals and cues around you, including the actions of other people. By understanding how these signals and cues affect you, you can learn to recognize and control their influence. And just as important, you can learn to use those signals and cues to shape the goals of your employees, students, and children.

## How Believing Shapes Achieving

Beliefs about Intelligence **Your beliefs about your strengths and your weaknesses play a large role in determining the goals you set for yourself.** If I believe that I’m good at math and science, then setting myself the goal of becoming an engineer makes sense for me. If I believe that I am uncoordinated and slow, then trying to make the varsity basketball team probably doesn’t make so much sense. Our beliefs about our abilities influence what we think is possible—and what we might realistically be able to achieve.

**Interestingly, it’s not just whether or not you think you have ability that matters.** **In fact, what seems to be most important is whether or not you think you can get ability.** 成长性心智 In other words, do you think that intelligence (or personality, or athletic prowess) is something that is fixed, or something that is malleable? Is a person stuck at a certain level of smartness, or can they get smarter? Psychologists call these beliefs _implicit theories_—they are personal beliefs about the kind of thing intelligence is (or personality, or morality, or any other kind of characteristic or quality.) They are called implicit because they aren’t necessarily something you’ve thought consciously or deliberately about. But despite the fact that we may not even realize that we hold them, these theories are powerful shapers of the choices we make for ourselves every day.

Let’s start with implicit theories of intelligence. Take a moment to complete the following exercise in your notebook.

### What Is Intelligence, Anyway?44

Take a moment to answer the questions below. Try to be completely honest. (I know they are a little repetitive, but bear with me.)
1. You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can’t do much to change it.

2. Your intelligence is something about you that you can’t change very much.

3. To be honest, you can’t really change how intelligent you are.

Now, add up your score.

What makes someone smart? **If you believe that smartness is something you are more or less born with, something that is largely genetic, or something that develops in childhood but then is pretty much constant through adulthood, then you are an entity theorist when it comes to your intelligence.** (And if you scored 10 or higher, then this is the theory for you.) The “entity” theory of intelligence is, in a nutshell, the belief that a person has a certain amount of intelligence and that there isn’t anything anyone can do about it (in other words, intelligence is an unchanging entity). You are either smart or you’re not.

On the other hand, **if you believe that smartness is a quality that is developed over time through experience and learning, and that people can get more of it if they apply themselves, then you are an incremental theorist.** (And if you scored 9 or lower, this is the theory you believe in.) The “incremental” theory of intelligence is the belief that smartness is a _malleable_ quality—people can get smarter at any point in their lives.

Implicit theories can sometimes be more specific, too—focusing on a single trait or attribute. For example, most Americans believe that mathematical aptitude is more of a fixed entity—that you’re either good at math or you’re not. But when it comes to _overall intelligence_, it seems to be split down the middle, with just about everybody falling into either the entity or incremental camp. And like most people, you may not have ever thought about which camp you’re in until you answered those questions above. But whichever theory sounds right to you, even if you never stopped to consciously think about it before, it has almost certainly shaped your life and the goals you have chosen for yourself in profoundly important ways.

Much of the work that has been done to identify and understand implicit theories comes from the laboratory of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. In her book Mindset, she elaborates on the many ways in which our beliefs about our own ability to grow and develop (or inability to do so) shape every aspect of our lives. Across dozens of studies, Dweck and her students have shown that people who believe their personal traits, like smartness, are fixed become overly concerned with receiving validation. They want, whenever possible, to receive confirmation that they are smart (or, at the very least, that they are not stupid). They want to feel smart. They want to look smart. And if you think about it, this makes a good deal of sense.

If I only have a fixed amount of smartness, then it’s really important for me to have a lot of it, since I can’t actually get any more. And remember that being smart isn’t just a matter of pride or flattering your ego—you want to have high ability so that you can be a successful person and get the things in life you want. So if you are an entity theorist when it comes to intelligence, your primary goal becomes proving to yourself and to everyone else that you are quite smart, every chance you get.

Not surprisingly, **_entity theorists_ make choices and set goals designed specifically to validate their intelligence.** **As a rule, they avoid goals that are too challenging, preferring the safer bets.** About this I can speak from personal experience, since I was, until graduate school, very much a die-hard entity theorist. Like a lot of people, I thought that a person was smart when it came to particular subjects because her genes made her that way. Also, like a majority of Americans, I believed in something that psychologists call _the inverse effort rule_—if you have to work hard at something, you aren’t good at it. **Effort compensates for a lack of ability.** So whenever possible, I chose subjects that came easily to me —ones that made me look and feel smart.

When I was twelve, I begged my parents to buy a piano, and I took about a year of piano lessons. Then I realized that I would have to work really, really hard to become even a halfway decent pianist, and I quit. It’s a decision that I have always regretted. You see, because I quit, I robbed myself of all the enjoyment and satisfaction I could have gotten from playing the piano, even if I never played particularly well. **Entity theorists shortchange themselves in this way all the time by concentrating too much on proving themselves at the expense of experiences that could potentially enrich their lives.** Incremental theorists tend not to make that mistake. When you believe that your ability—any ability —can be grown and developed over time, you focus not so much on proving you are smart, but on cultivating your smartness. **Challenges aren’t threatening — _they_ are opportunities to acquire new skills.** **Mistakes don’t mean you are stupid—they are full of information that can help you to learn.** I often marvel at the number of skills my mother has acquired in her adult life—things that she had little experience with growing up and no formal training in. My mother has taught herself to draw charcoal sketches, quilt elaborate and intricate patterns, design and create her own clothing, and is practically a master gardener. She refinishes furniture. She built a rock wall around her property, with rocks she dug out of that property, by herself. And when I was growing up, I don’t remember her doing any of these things. It’s not as if she never makes mistakes. She does—particularly when she’s learning something totally new. Her early quilts were overly ambitious and the stitching wasn’t perfect. Some of her plants didn’t thrive. Sometimes, part of the rock wall would fall down. But even though she found these experiences frustrating, she learned from them, and she never doubted that she would “get the hang of it eventually.” And that’s because when it comes to drawing, sewing, gardening, painting, and building rock walls, my mom is an incremental theorist.

Looking for evidence that implicit theories do indeed shape our choices, Dweck asked junior high and college students to describe the goals they pursued in the classroom. Those who believed their intelligence was fixed agreed with statements like “Although I hate to admit it, I would rather do well in a class than learn a lot” and “If I knew I wasn’t going to do well at a task, I probably wouldn’t do it even if I might learn a lot from it.” Those students who believed their intelligence could be increased preferred statements like “It’s much more important for me to learn things in my classes than it is to get the best grades.”

In another study of college students, this time at the University of Hong Kong, Dweck and her colleagues showed how these beliefs can influence important real-life decisions. At the University of Hong Kong, all classes are conducted entirely in English, despite the fact that some of the students are not yet proficient in English when they arrive on campus. So Dweck asked those students whose English could use some improvement if they would be interested in enrolling in a remedial English proficiency course. Only the students who believed that they could get smarter (the incremental theorists) showed any interest in the course—73 percent of these students were willing to enroll. Those who believed their smartness was fixed (the entity theorists) wanted nothing to do with it—only 13 percent of these students expressed a willingness to take the course. Most of them did not think a remedial course could actually help them improve. And just as important, they believed that taking a remedial course would publicly expose their lack of ability.
