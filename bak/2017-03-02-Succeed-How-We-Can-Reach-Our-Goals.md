Let’s start with the abstract, why kind of thinking. **Thinking more abstractly about behavior can be very energizing because you are linking one particular, often small action to a greater meaning or purpose.** Something that may not seem important or valuable on its own can be cast in a whole new light. For example, when staying that extra hour at work is thought of as “helping my career” rather than “typing for sixty more minutes,” I’m much more likely to want to stay put and work hard. The why of what you do is incredibly motivating, so it’s not surprising that many of us often prefer to think of our own actions in those terms.

And **if you want to motivate someone else to do something, describing it in why terms will also help persuade them to give it a try.** If you want your son to study for his chemistry test, telling him that he should try to do well in chemistry because it will help him get into college is probably more inspiring than telling him he should open up his textbook and start memorizing all the elements on the periodic table. Either way he has to learn that H stands for hydrogen, but describing what he should do probably won’t light a fire under him, and describing why he should do it just might.

So is it ever helpful to think about the things we do in nitty-gritty, what-am-I-literally-doing ways? Yes. For one thing, it turns out that thinking this way is really useful when you need to do something that is difficult, unfamiliar, complex, or just takes a lot of time to learn. If you’ve never operated a vacuum cleaner before, you’re actually better off thinking “sucking up crumbs” (what) than “keeping things clean” (why).

For example, psychologists Dan Wegner and Robin Vallacher asked experienced coffee drinkers to drink a cup of coffee and then rate how well each of thirty different descriptions fit with what they had just done. (I’ll bet you didn’t think there even were thirty ways to describe drinking a cup of coffee. I know I didn’t.) Their choices included relatively abstract, why-based descriptions like “promoting my caffeine habit” and “getting energized,” along with more concrete, literal, what-based descriptions like “drinking a liquid” and “swallowing.”

Half of the people who participated in the study got to drink out of a normal, everyday coffee mug. The other half were given a much more unwieldy mug weighing nearly half a pound. (Some of you are probably thinking that’s not really very heavy. So I should point out that this was 1983, and nobody was drinking enormous Starbucks coffees out of containers the size of an oxygen tank back then. A half- pound mug was a really heavy mug in 1983.) When they were asked to choose the best descriptions for what they had just done, the people who got to drink out of a typical coffee mug tended to prefer the why descriptions over the what descriptions. In other words, under normal conditions, people who are used to drinking coffee preferred thinking about drinking coffee in terms of the reason why they were drinking it. But the heavy-mug drinkers strongly preferred the more concrete what descriptions. They were thinking about the specific actions they were taking, like “raising a cup to my lips.” You see, in order to actually manage to drink out of a cup that was much heavier than anything they normally used without spilling, these people needed to think about the real mechanics of coffee drinking. They needed to concentrate on the what of what they were doing (i.e., grasping the handle firmly, raising the cups to their lips, swallowing), rather than the why. By focusing on the concrete what, they were able to successfully drink from the odd and unfamiliar cup without making a mistake. If they had thought only in abstract why terms, “getting energized” might have easily become “getting scalded and wet.”

Wegner and Vallacher found the same results in a study where students were asked to eat Cheerios either with their hands or with _chopsticks_. Those who had to use chopsticks preferred to think of their actions as “putting food in my mouth” and “moving my hands” (what) rather than as “_reducing hunger_” or “getting nutrition” (why). Again and again, we find that **when actions are difficult to accomplish, it is easier and much more helpful to think about what we are doing in simple, concrete what terms rather than lofty, more abstract why ones.** (At this point, you may be wondering if social psychologists get _a particular pleasure_ out of asking people to do really odd things, like eating Cheerios with chopsticks, or eating raw radishes, or not laughing at Robin Williams. The short answer is yes, we do. It makes up for all those hours spent learning statistics.)

**As we gain more experience doing something and it becomes easier for us, we often start to see it in a more abstract why way—more in terms of its meaning or purpose.** For example, in one study, more inexperienced, underage drinkers tended to describe drinking an alcoholic beverage as “swallowing” or “lifting a glass,” while inpatients in an alcoholism treatment program preferred thinking of it as “relieving tension” or “overcoming boredom.” The ones who were relatively new to drinking alcohol were, presumably, less personally familiar with the reasons why you drink. The alcoholics, on the other hand, knew the reasons all too well.

When people think about what they are doing in why terms, they are guided by the big picture—their smaller, everyday actions become a part of something larger and more important. They are more connected to long-term goals. As a result, when people think why rather than what, they are less impulsive, less vulnerable to temptation, and more likely to plan their actions in advance. (Okay, maybe not when the why thinkers in question are alcoholics, but you get my point.) _Thinking why, they feel more certain of who they are and what they want._ And they are much less likely to feel that forces outside of them (like other people, luck, or fate) are controlling what happens to them.

When people think about what they are doing in what terms, they are focused on the nitty-gritty—the actual mechanics of getting from Point A to Point B. And while they are sometimes less motivated, and more in danger of not seeing the forest for the trees, they are particularly _adept at navigating_ a rocky road. When what you need to do is particularly difficult to get done, it pays to forget about the bigger picture and focus on the task at hand.

So, since both the “big picture” why and “nitty-gritty” what modes of thinking have their advantages and disadvantages, **the best strategy is to _shift_ your thinking style to match the goal you want to achieve.** Sometimes this happens automatically, but not always. It’s important to make sure you are using the optimal style, and if not, to shift accordingly. **To get motivated and enhance your self-control (or to help someone else do the same), think why.** Consider the larger meaning or purpose behind what you are doing. If you want to stick to your diet when faced with the allure of the dessert tray, remember why you are trying to lose weight. When your employees are doing a lackluster job, remind them of why their performance matters—for the company and for themselves.

**To tackle a particularly complicated, difficult, or unfamiliar goal, on the other hand, it’s best to think what.** When faced with learning a new routine, break it down into specific steps. Skiing for the first time? Focus on keeping your knees bent and your ski tips together. Forget about impressing everyone with your speed and grace—that’s a great way for a novice skier to end up wrapped around a tree.

Complete the exercise below to see how you can do this with goals you already have. (A quick note: Throughout the book, I’ll be giving you written exercises to help you learn how to use new strategies to improve your achievement. When you’re learning something new, writing it down step by step is an excellent way to help make it a habit. Consider keeping a notebook just for practicing the exercises in this book. Eventually, with practice, your brain will embrace the new strategy and begin to use it automatically, so you won’t need to go to the trouble of written exercises. But for the time being, taking the trouble to actually write it all down is really worth your while.)

### How to Think “Why”

  1. Write down an action you’ve had trouble taking recently because you haven’t felt motivated or you’ve given in too much to temptation. It can be anything from not ordering dessert to answering all your important e-mails each day.

  2. Now, write down why you want to take that action. What is the purpose of the action for you? What goal does it help you to achieve? How will you benefit from it?

The next time you attempt this action, stop and think about the why you just identified. Repeat this over and over again, until it becomes a habit (and it will—with repetition, any relatively simple act will become automatic and effortless. You just have to keep at it.)

### How to Think “What”

  1. Write down something you want to accomplish that is really complicated, highly difficult, or very unfamiliar or new to you. Maybe you want to create your own website but aren’t experienced with computers, or perhaps you are thinking about starting a new career.

  2. Now, write down what your first step should be. What is the specific action that you need to take in order to begin to accomplish this goal?

The next time you think about this goal, stop and think about the very next specific action you need to take and focus on that. This too will quickly become a habit.
