### What Self-Control Is Really Like


[1] Actually, it makes perfect sense if you understand the true nature of self-control. And recently, **in light of** some very interesting research findings, psychologists have come to understand that the capacity for self-control is very much like a muscle. That’s right—like a bicep or tricep. <u>I know that sounds odd, but let me explain.</u>

我知道这听上去很滑稽，但请容许我解释给你听。

<!-- more -->

> drawing knowledge or information from; taking (something) into consideration

[2] Like a muscle, self-control can vary in its strength—not only from person to person, but from moment to moment. Even well-developed biceps sometimes get tired, and so **too does** your self-control muscle. In one of the earliest tests of this theory of self-control strength (or self-regulatory strength, as it is sometimes called), Roy Baumeister and his colleagues presented very hungry college students with a bowl of chocolates and a bowl of **radishes『萝卜』**.

就像肌肉那样，自制力的强度不同-不仅因人而异，也因时而异。非常发达的肌肉有时也会累，你的自制力亦是如此。


> If things vary, they are different from each other in size, amount, or degree.

[3] Both bowls were placed on a table in front of each student, who was then left alone to stare at the bowls. Some of the students were asked to eat two or three of the radishes during their alone time, and to not eat any of the chocolates. Others (the lucky ones) were asked to eat two or three chocolates, while avoiding the radishes. Compared to the chocolate eaters, the radish eaters should have had to use up a fair amount of self-control. It’s hard enough for most people to eat a raw radish, or to not eat readily available chocolates—just imagine doing both.


[4] Next, to see how much self-control the students in each group had used up, Baumeister gave them each a puzzle to work on. The puzzle was difficult—actually, it was unsolvable—but what interested Baumeister was how long the students would work on it before giving up. As the “muscle” theory would predict, he found that the radish eaters gave up much faster than the chocolate eaters. They even reported feeling more tired afterward.


[5] So how does this relate to you and me, and to situations that don’t necessarily involve radishes? Think of it this way—if you’ve just finished working out, chances are your muscles will be tired, and you’ll have sapped some of the strength you started with when you arrived at the gym. If you’ve just finished doing something that requires a lot of self-control (like producing a television show or leading the free world), you’ve probably spent a lot of your self-control strength as well. Recent research shows that even everyday actions like making a decision or trying to make a good impression can **sap** this valuable resource. **People who are very successful in one or more areas of their life are successful precisely because that’s where they devote the bulk of their capacity for self-control.** When you deal with a lot of stress all day, no matter who you are, you may find yourself depleted and vulnerable to goal failure.

> If something saps your strength or confidence, it gradually weakens or destory it.

那些在一个或多个人生领域里获得巨大成功的人恰恰是把大部分自制力投入到了那些相应的领域中了。

In an article in O magazine, Oprah concludes a discussion of her most recent weight gain by observing:

What I’ve learned this year is that my weight issue isn’t about eating less or working out harder ... It’s about my life being out of balance, with too much work and not enough play, not enough time to calm down. I let the well run dry『我让这口井干涸了』.



I think that last remark is particularly insightful and right on the money. **When you tax it too much, the well of self-control will certainly run dry.**

- tax 消耗，榨取
- well 井

### What You Can Do about It

So perhaps now you’re thinking, “Okay, my failure to lose weight isn’t because I lack willpower in general, but because I’ve spent it all on other important goals, like **succeeding** at work. Great. How does that help me, exactly?” Fair enough. <u>It helps you because, if you understand the kind of thing self- control is, you can plan accordingly.</u> This brings us to another way in which self-control is like a muscle —namely, that if you rest it for a while, you get your strength back. **Depletion is only temporary, and you are most vulnerable immediately after you’ve used up your self-control reserves.** Did you ever notice how dealing with a temptation seems to get easier over time? It may feel like torture to forgo that dessert or cigarette, or to think about starting work on that project you’ve been dreading, but it doesn’t keep torturing you quite so much as time passes. If you can get past that moment when your self-control is nearly spent and give it time to bounce back, you’re probably going to be just fine.

> If you succeed in doing something, you manage to do it.

如果你知道了自制力是怎么回事，便可以更好地制定计划。

- depletion
- temporary
- use up


There are other ways around this problem, too. **A lack of self-control strength can sometimes be overcome with well-chosen incentives or rewards.** Psychologists Mark Muraven and Elisaveta Slessareva told students participating in a study at Case Western Reserve University to watch a five- minute video clip of Robin Williams performing a particularly funny piece of stand-up. Half of the students were told that they would be under observation and were instructed not to laugh or smile while watching the video. This took a lot of self-control (it was a very funny clip), and it sapped their willpower resources. To demonstrate this depletion, all of the students were then given a cup of orange Kool-Aid to drink—except instead of using sugar, the experimenters made it with vinegar. It was unpleasant, though drinkable if you forced yourself. If you’ve ever psyched yourself up to swallow cold medicine, you know that it’s an act that requires significant self-control, but it’s doable.

Muraven and Slessareva didn’t stop there—they also varied how much the students would be paid for every ounce of vinegar Kool-Aid they managed to get down. When the students were receiving relatively low pay for drinking the vinegar Kool-Aid (one cent per ounce), those who had been allowed to laugh at Robin Williams drank twice as much as those who had to suppress their laughter, demonstrating that that latter group had indeed depleted their self-control strength. But among students who were paid well (twenty-five cents per ounce) the effect completely disappeared. Even the suppressors managed to drink down quite a lot of the gross concoction.

Does this mean that money can create self-control? Or, to put it differently, that rewards can **replenish** your willpower? Not exactly—it’s probably more accurate to say that **increasing your motivation through better rewards can help you compensate for a temporary loss of self-control.** This is no doubt why so many successful dieters report that they used nonfood rewards as a key part of their diet strategies. Increasing your motivation, in whatever way works for you, is an excellent way to tip the scales back in your favor when you’re just too tired to resist temptation.

> If you replenish something, you make it full or complete again.

- compensate for sth
- loss

**Another way in which willpower, or self-control, is different than you may have imagined is that it’s neither innate nor unchangeable. Self-control is learned, and developed and made stronger (or weaker) over time.** If you want more self-control, you can get more. And you get more self-control the same way you get bigger muscles—you’ve got to give it regular workouts. Recent research has shown that engaging in daily activities such as exercising, keeping track of your finances or what you are eating— or even just remembering to sit up straight every time you think of it—can help you develop your overall self-control capacity. For example, in one study, students who were assigned to (and stuck to) a daily exercise program not only got physically healthier, but they also became more likely to wash dishes instead of leaving them in the sink, and less likely to impulsively spend money.

- innate 内在的、天生的

> An innate quality or ability is one which a person is born with.

In another demonstration of how self-control strength can be increased through regular use, Matthew Gailliot and his colleagues asked participants in an experiment to spend two weeks using their nondominant hand to do things like brush their teeth, stir drinks, eat, open doors, and use the computer mouse. (In another version of this study, they asked participants to refrain from cursing, only speak in complete sentences, say yes and no instead of yeah and nope, and avoid starting sentences with I.) After two weeks of training their self-control muscle, compared to a no-training group, they performed significantly better on a task that required self-control. Specifically, they were better able to avoid using any stereotypes when forming an impression of a person. Sadly, that turns out to be very hard to do, though that is a topic for another book.

### The Topic of This Book

I’ve spent a lot of time in this introduction talking about self-control, not only because it’s important, but because it’s a great example of how our intuitions about things that seem obvious can sometimes fail us. And consequently, it’s also a great example of how the science of psychology can be really useful— helping us to see not only what kind of thing willpower really is, but also how we can, if we want to, get our hands on some more of it.

This book isn’t actually just about willpower, however. It’s about achieving goals, and self-control is just one piece of that puzzle. Specifically, **Succeed is about understanding how goals work, what tends to go wrong, and what you can do to reach your goals or to help others reach theirs.**

Too much of the advice you’ll typically hear about reaching your goals is both obvious and useless— we all know we’re supposed to do things like “Stay Positive!” “Make a Plan!” and “Take Action!” But why do I need to stay positive? Is that even always true? (No.) And what kind of plan should I make? Does it matter? (Yes.) And how do I take action? I know that to lose weight I need to eat less and exercise more, but I never seem to actually do it. Can I fix that? (You bet.)

Some of the advice in this book may surprise you—in fact, I’m certain it will. But that advice is drawn from excellent sources—not only my own research on goals and motivation, but several decades and many hundreds of rigorous experimental and field studies, conducted by some of the world’s leading scientific psychologists.

I wish that I could have called this book Succeed: The Three Things You Need to Do to Reach All Your Goals. At the very least, I’d probably sell more books that way. But it’s not that simple—there are more than three things you need to know. For example, it turns out that there are many ways to frame the same goal in your mind. Do you think of getting that promotion as something you ideally would achieve, or as something you ought to achieve? Is mastering your classwork about developing skills or proving that you’re smart? Those differences matter—differently framed goals need to be pursued with different strategies and are more or less vulnerable to different kinds of errors. Frame a goal one way, and the person pursuing it will work hard but never love what he is doing. Frame a goal another way, and you’ll create interest and enjoyment—but to be honest, probably not spectacular performance (at least not in the short run). For some goals, confidence is essential, while for others it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re sure or shaky. The important thing is that while achieving your goals is a bit more complicated than just doing “Three Things,” it’s not overly complicated, either. In Part 1 of the book, “Get Ready,” I’ll talk about the key principles of goal-setting that seem to be universally true, whether you’re pursuing goals at work, in relationships, or for self-development. In Part 2, “Get Set,” you’ll learn about the different kinds of goals we set for ourselves, focusing on the few distinctions that seem to matter the most. I’ll show you how to choose the goal that will work best for you personally in your situation. And you’ll learn how to instill the most beneficial goals in your children, students, and employees. In Part 3, “Go,” I’ll take you step by step through the most common reasons why we fail to reach our goals once we’ve started pursuing them. And you’ll learn effective, often simple and easy-to-implement strategies for avoiding these pitfalls in the future.

In the last decade or two, social psychologists have come to know a lot about how goals work. Succeed is my attempt to take that knowledge out of the academic journals and handbooks and spread it around a bit more so that it can do some good.
